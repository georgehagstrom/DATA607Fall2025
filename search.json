Additionally, I am a consultant with Princeton University where I development mathematical models of marine phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria to improve our understanding of the Earth’s Biogeochemical Cycles. Prior to joining CUNY, I was a Research Scientist at Princeton University in the Levin lab at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a postdoctoral researcher in the Magneto Fluids Division at the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences. My research interests include the application of Bayesian statistics and Machine Learning to incorporate nontraditional datasets (such as from ’omics) into mechanistic models of marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling, trait-based modeling, and critical transitions in complex ecological, social, or economic systems. In my free time, I enjoy cycling and exploring New York City.\n\nContact\nOffice Hours (Zoom is preferred): By appointment. You’re encouraged to schedule an appointment and I have time nearly everyday. You are also encouraged to ask us questions on Slack.

RStudio supports git directly, but I recommend downloading Sourcetree. This is a free desktop client that provides an easier interface for working with Github. You will also need to create an account on Github.\nFor more information, Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and Github for the useR is a free online book covering the important features of source control for R users.\n\n\nR Packages\n\nOnce everything is installed, execute the following command in RStudio to install the packages we will use for this class (you can copy-and-paste):\n\ninstall.packages(c('openintro','devtools','tidyverse', 'ggplot2',\n                   'psych','reshape2','knitr','markdown','shiny','R.rsp',\n                   'fivethirtyeight'))\n\n\n\nTinyTeX\n\nTinyTeX is a lightweight implementation of LaTeX that is highly compatible with RStudio and can be installed relatively easily compared to other LaTeX implementations that you might encounter. LaTeX is an advanced typesetting library that is essential for properly formatting pdf documents for submission. One of the most common “tech” issues arising for students in this class is getting a working LaTeX implementation. Thus I highly recommend that you install TinyTeX right away.

These are somewhat dated but contain important insights:\n\nExploratory Data Analysis. J. W. Tukey. (1977).\nVisualizing Data. W. S. Cleveland. (1993). Hobart press.\nExploratory data mining and data cleaning. T. Dasu and T. Johnson. (2003).

(2015).\n\n\n\nVideos\n\nWhole Game Live demo of an Exploratory Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham. This isn’t a super polished video but its really nice to see examples of experts going through their process. The code he typed and data that he used can be found on github. This video has more of a focus on exploring and finding patterns rather than finding problems in a poor dataset.\nDebugging Video This is an excellent lecture on debugging by the author of your github textbook. Debugging is an absolutely crucial skill and having a systematic approach can save you an enormous amount of time. The video is one hour but if you get good at debugging that will pay off very quickly\n\n\n\nOther Resources\n\npredictive package for tidymodels This is an LLM driven coding agent that runs from R studio. Requires a Claude API key, but it is very good for suggesting things to try (and trying them) in an EDA context (though it is not that great for its primary task which is modeling).",

We will discuss principles of good visualizations and how to use the ggplot2 package for combinations of numerical and categorical data. ggplot2 is based on a conceptual framework called the “grammar of graphics”, which you will become familiar with as we build plots. Your first homework assignment, Lab 1, will be due at the end of this week. Your reading will also cover some of the basics of using R which might be a review if you already are an experienced user.

    "text": "Text data is unlike other data formats which naturally have a rectangular or tabular form, necessitating a different type of analysis. The field known as Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, has developed tools and techniques for deriving insight from textual data. In this module we will learn some of the basics of NLP and practice using them in a tidyverse context using the tidytext package.\nIn particular, we will learn about tokenization and how to tokenize text into a tidy format. Then we will explore some sentiment lexicons, which classify words according to whether they convey negative or positive emotions (either categorically or numerically), or as exemplars of some other emotional category. Sentiment analysis is an important part of many commercial applications of data science, but is challenging due to the nuance and complexities of language (e.g. sarcasm, satire). We will also study how to interpret the frequency of words in a text, using the underlying frequency distribution in a corpus as a base rate to normalize against. This can allow us to learn the topic or infer the most important context from a body of text automatically. Finally, we will study groupings of words, i.e. n-grams, using them to understand correlations between terms or when the presence of two words together alters meaning.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nThe tidy text format\nLexicons and sentiment analysis\nWord frequency analysis and Zipf’s Law\nn-grams and correlations\n\n\n\nReadings\n\nText Mining with R: Chapters 1-4\n\n\n\nVideos\n\nVideo Intro to Sentiment Analysis",

    "section": "Course Overview",
    "text": "Course Overview\n\nThe main goal of this course is to provide you with a strong foundation in the non-modeling side of data science. You will learn how to take a messy data set and convert it into a format amenable to analysis. This includes rooting out problems in the data, visualizing the data and informally exploring patterns to generate hypotheses, storing data so it is easy to work with, acquiring data automatically from the web, working with complex data types like graphs, and using distributed computing techniques to work with very large datasets.\nWe will also talk about some data ethics issues, practice presentation skills, and learn how to use some collaborative software tools, and how to use LLMs\nAlthough people often think of models when they think about data science, the preparatory work you will learn to do in this course probably comprises 80% of the work that a data scientist does. By mastering the tools in 607, you will become much stronger as a data scientist, increasing the scope of data you can work with, decreasing the change of making mistakes, and opening the potential to link with other lucrative career paths like data engineering.\n\n\nEverything in Data Science other than modeling\nData tidying, wrangling, cleaning, visualizations, exploratory data analysis, collaborative programming, LLM basics\nWorking with a variety of data types including strings and text, graphs, hierarchical structures, and relational databases\nIntroduce more advanced programming concepts, tools for large data sets and distributed computing.\nLots of R, some SQL, some data ethics"

After watching each meetup you will be asked to complete a short reflection on what you learned.\nThe meetups will be a mixture of lecture, live coding, and discussion.\nWe will have 10 weekly lab assignments that are an important part of your grade. You are encouraged to discuss these with your classmates on slack but what you turn in should be your own work. There will be two “collaborative” programming assignments, one short data science in context presentation, and a final project where you pick an area of interest and assemble and study data related to it.\n\n\nWeekly meetup (Monday 6:45PM) - combo of lecture, live coding, discussion.\n10 Weekly lab assignments and two collaborative programming assignments\nWeekly meetup reflection and one data science in context presentation\nFinal project and presentation\nUse Slack page for discussion, arrange meetings to get help"

The success of Airbnb has not come without controversies, with critics arguing that Airbnb has adverse impacts on housing and rental prices and also on the daily lives of people living in neighborhoods where Airbnb is popular. This controversy has been particularly intense in NYC, where the debate been Airbnb proponents and detractors eventually led to the city imposing strong restrictions on the use of Airbnb. If you find this issue interesting and want to go deeper, there is the potential for an interesting project that brings in hotels (which have interesting regulations in NYC), hotel price data, and rental data and looks at these things together.\nBecause Airbnb listings are available online through their website and app, it is possible for us to acquire and visualize the impacts of Airbnb on different cities, including New York City. This is possible through the work of an organization called inside airbnb"

Note: the dataset for this assignment is a bit bigger than what we have typically worked with in the class. On my computer everything worked fast enough, but if your computer is older and you find the computations intolerably slow you may reduce the size of the dataset by 90% by taking only the first 10% of reviews. If you do this make sure it is clearly stated. I have also listed a second shorter version of the file.\nProblem 1: Sentiment and Review Score\n\nDownload “simple_reviews.json” from the following google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bk_2ihR5gQ8k6Tkn0NNpB58K1efruKnX?usp=sharing, read it into R, and rectangle it so that it is a dataframe where each row contains a single amazon review. If this file is too large, click here to download a shorter version where 90% of the reviews have been dropped].\nTo make sentiment analysis possible, add an index variable to the review data frame so that each review is uniquely identified by an integer. Then tokenize the review data frame using words as the tokens, and remove all stop words from the data set.\nDoes sentiment correlate with reviews? Use the afinn lexicon to calculate a sentiment score for each review, normalizing by the number of lexicon words in each review. Visualize the distribution of sentiment scores for each rating and calculate the mean sentiment score for each review category.

Filter for reviewers who have written more than 10 reviews, and plot the relationship between mean rating and mean sentiment. What do you observe?\n\nProblem 2: Words with high relative frequency \n\nAs your starting point, take the tokenized data frame that has been filtered to remove stop words, but hasn’t been joined with the sentiment lexicon data. For each item (asin), use the bind_tf_idf function to find the word that occurs in the reviews of that item with the highest frequency relative to the frequency of words in the entire review test dataset.\nSelect five items from the dataset (either at random or by hand) and look up the asin code for those items on Amazon.com. In each of these cases, does the highest relative frequency word correspond to the identify or type of the item that you chose? You may not be able to find every single item, but I was able to find a solid majority of the ones I searched for by searching amazon.com for the asin.\n\nProblem 3: Bigrams and Sentiment\n\nConsider the two negative words not and don't. Starting from the original dataset, tokenize the data into bigrams. Then calculate the frequency of bigrams that start with either not or don't. What are the 10 most common words occurring after not and after don't? What are their sentiment values according to the afinn lexicon?\nPick the most commonly occurring bigram where the first word is not or don't and the afinn sentiment of the second word is 2 or greater.

    "text": "Overview\nThis is a two part assignment. In the first part of the assignment you will practice rectangling on a dataset from the repurrrsive package. In the second part you will combine the rvest package along with functions and iteration to scrape data on foreign linked political action committees from the website open secrets.\n\n\nRectangling\nProblem 1: Load the repurrrsive package to get access to get access to the got_chars dataset. In section 23.4.2 of R4DS, there is code that extracts data from the got_chars list and converts it into a tibble with information on each character and a separate tibble which contains information on the titles held by each character. Perform similar operations to create separate tibbles containing the aliases, allegiances, books, and TV series of each Game of Thrones character.\n\n\nWebscraping Open Secrets\nIn this assignment we will scrape and work with data foreign connected PACs that donate to US political campaigns. In the United States, only American citizens and green card holders can contribute to federal elections, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees.\nFirst, we will get data foreign connected PAC contributions in the 2022 election cycle. Then, you will use a similar approach to get data such contributions from previous years so that we can examine trends over time.\nIn order to complete this assignment you will need a Chrome browser with the Selector Gadget extension installed.\nIn addition to tidyverse, you will need to install and load the packages robotstxt and rvest\nProblem 2:\n\nCheck that open secrets allows you to webscrape by running the paths_allowed function on the url https://www.opensecrets.org.\nWrite a function called scrape_pac() that scrapes information from the Open Secrets webpage for foreign connected PAC contributions in a given year. The url for this data is https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2024. This function should take the url of the webpage as its only input and should output a data frame. The variables of this data-frame should be renamed so that they are in snake_case format (lower_case_and_underscores_for_spaces, see R4DS section 2.3). Use str_squish() to remove excess whitespace from the Country of Origin/Parent Company variables, and add a new column which records the year by extracting from the input url.\n\nHint: If you have trouble finding the right elements to search for using the selector gadget try looking for a table element.\n\nTest your function on the urls for 2024, 2022, and 2000, and show the first several rows of each of the outpus. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?\n\nProblem 3:\n\nConstruct a vector called urls that contains the URLs for each webpage that contains information on foreign-connected PAC contributions for a given year (combine seq and string functions). Using the map_dfr function from the purrr package, apply the scrape_pac() function over urls in a way that will result in a data frame called pac_all that contains the data for all of the years.\nClean this combined dataset by separating the country of origin from the parent company (use separate_wider_delim or another tool of your choice, you will need to be cautious with some special cases in this column) and by converting the strings in the total, dems, and repubs columns into numbers. Print out the top 10 rows over your dataset after completing these steps.\nCalculate the total contributions from PACs linked to Canada and Mexico each year and plot how these contributions change over time.\nFind the 5 countries who over the entire time period of the dataset have the greatest total contribution from affiliated PACs. Then calculate the total contribution for each of those countries for each year of the data and make a plot of it to visualize how the contributions have changed over time."

Then create a Cleveland Multiway Dot Plot (see this tutorial page for a description for how) to visualize the difference in flight delays between the two airlines at each city in the dataset.

Notice that there are many NA values in the ingredient columns, indicating that most cocktails have under 6 ingredients.\nTidy this dataset using pivot_longer to create a new data frame where each there is a row corresponding to each ingredient of all the cocktails, and an additional variable specifying the “rank” of that cocktail in the original recipe, i.e. it should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ncategory\nIngredient_Rank\nIngredient\n\n\n\n\nGauguin\nCocktail Classics\n1\nLight Rum\n\n\nGauguin\nCocktail Classics\n2\nPassion Fruit Syrup\n\n\nGauguin\nCocktail Classics\n3\nLemon Juice\n\n\nGauguin\nCocktail Classics\n4\nLime Juice\n\n\nFort Lauderdale\nCocktail Classics\n1\nLight Rum\n\n\n\nwhere the data-type of Ingredient_Rank is an integer. Hint: Use the parse_number() function in mutate after your initial pivot.\nProblem 4: Some of the ingredients in the ingredient list have different names, but are nearly the same thing. An example of such a pair is Lemon Juice and Juice of a lemon, which are considered different ingredients in this dataset, but which perhaps should be treated as the same depending on the analysis you are doing.\n\nMake a list of the ingredients appearing in the ingredient list ranked by how commonly they occur along with the number of occurrences, and print the first 10 elements of the list here. Then check more ingredients (I suggest looking at more ingredients and even sorting them alphabetically using arrange(asc(ingredient))) and see if you can spot pairs of ingredients that are similar but have different names. Use if_else( click here for if_else ) or case_when in combination with mutate to make it so that the pairs of ingredients you found have the same name. You don’t have to find all pairs, but find at least 5 pairs of ingredients to rename. Because the purpose of this renaming is to facilitate a hypothetical future analysis, you can choose your own criteria for similarity as long as it is somewhat justifiable.\nThis type of fuzzy text matching is a tedious problem to do by hand and is the sort of problem where an LLM can be very effective. Pick two different LLMs and prompt them to analyze the list of ingredients to identify groups of ingredients with multiple names. Investigate the lists that you found using the LLMs and compare them to each-other and the ingredients you identified by hand. How much overlap is there between the two LLM solutions? Do you agree with all the ingredient names that were paired together? For this problem report the prompts that you used in addition to the output- put some thought into the formatting of you show this output, you can also submit csv files that show which values go together instead.\n\nThe class has not yet covered how to automate the replacement you did “by hand” in the first part of this question, but in Module 7 you will learn about a tool called left_join that when combined with if_else lets you rename everything based on the LLM output in two lines of code.\nAlso Notice that there are some ingredients that appear to be two or more ingredients strung together with commas. These would be candidates for more cleaning though this exercise doesn’t ask you to fix them.\nProblem 5: Some operations are easier to do on wide data rather than tall data. Find the 10 most common pairs of ingredients occurring in the top 2 ingredients in a recipe (using the renamed data). It is much easier to do this with a wide dataset, so use pivot_wider to change the data so that each row contains all of the ingredients of a single cocktail, just like in the format of the original data-set. Then use count on the 1 and 2 columns to determine the most common pairs (see chapter 3 for a refresher on count).\nNote: You may be interested to read about the widyr package here: widyr page. It is designed to solve problems like this one and uses internal pivot steps to accomplish it so that the final result is tidy. I’m actually unaware of any easy ways of solving problem 5 without pivoting to a wide dataset."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The idea of this project is for you to find data and do something interesting with it that relates to the skills you have developed in this course.\nThe project is intentionally open ended- this is an opportunity for you to explore your interests, through using techniques or technologies that branch off those that were introduced in this class, datasets related to problems you face in your career or that you are curious about, or both.\nA great project will demonstrate a complete “Data Science Workflow”, such as the one introduced at the beginning of the textbook, starting from multiple distinct datasets from public sources (if you have a private dataset that you want to use you may discuss that with me), data tidying, exploratory data analysis, cleaning, hypothesis generation, and lastly modeling. This course has not focused on modeling and the mathematical sophistication of your model will not factor heavily in your evaluation, but by this point in the semester you will have been exposed to enough modeling techniques in other courses to incorporate models within your project.\nThe output of your project should software that allows me to reproduce your work and a research report which describes what you did with the data and your findings, which could be contained within a github repository. You will also present your project in a short presentation in the final week of the semester.\n\n\nThe first step of your project is to submit an initial proposal, which will help to ensure that your project is both worthwhile and feasible in the time frame of the last half of the semester. Your proposal should describe the area that you are interested in (and if you have a specific question already you can describe that too), the datasets you are going to use, and your data analysis plan. Your proposal should be a maximum of 2 pages (excluding figures and references), and should include three sections (each with target length 1-2 paragraphs):\n\nSection 1 - Introduction: The introduction should describe the motivation for your project, the subject matter area of your dataset, and any general research questions you may already have.\nSection 2 - Data: At the time of submitting the proposal you should have already identified some datasets that you plan to use in your analysis. Give a quick description of those datasets here, describe where the data can be found, the number of variables and observations, and/or the output of the glimpse() or skim() functions on the data.\nSection 3 - Data analysis plan: Describe your initial approach to analyzing your data. How will your datasets need to be processed in for your to make use of all of them in the analysis? Which sort of comparisons do you plan to make in your exploratory data analysis (you can share early visualizations of this is you have them)? What statistical methods do you think are appropriate to address the questions that motivated your interest?\n\nThe proposal is preliminary, and you can include additional data or a different analysis as needs require.\n\n\n\nWhen writing proposals, I’ve found the following set of considerations, called “Heilmeier's Questions”, to be helpful to consider. Although this is just a short project, you might find them helpful as well, and useful for formulating future projects and proposals that you might have to complete. These questions were developed by Dr. George Heilmeier, who was the director of DARPA from 1975-1977. Heilmeier said that every proposal to DARPA needed to answer these questions clearly and completely in order to receive funding:\n\nWhat are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. What is the problem? Why is it hard?\nHow is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nWhat is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?\nWho cares?\nIf you’re successful, what difference will it make? What applications are enabled as a result?\nWhat are the risks?\nHow much will it cost?\nHow long will it take?\nWhat are the midterm and final “exams” to check for success? How will progress be measured?\n\n\n\n\nThe emphasis of class has been working with datasets that have different types of variables and which are messy or often heterogeneous. For this project you need to select data that comes from multiple sources (there should be at least two datasets). You should be able to access the data and it should be large enough and contain enough variables so that multiple interesting relationships can be explored. A good starting point is that across your dataset, there should be at least 50 observations and more than 10 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.\nNote on reusing datasets from class: Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class. Also do not use datasets exclusively from Kaggle or other sources of curated data for data science competitions (these have been made clean and tidy already).\nBelow are a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse.

    "text": "Part 1: Health Diagnostics and Diabetes Incidence\nProblem 1: Data Description and Outliers.\nLoad diabetes.csv into R and take a look at the data using the skimr package (make sure to install it if you don’t have it). Skimr provides a tidy summary function called skim. Use skim on the data frame that you loaded from diabetes.csv.\nSkim will list several variables. Pregnancies is the past number of pregnancies (this dataset includes women 21 years or older), glucose describes the concentration of glucose in the blood after an oral glucose tolerance test (drinking a sugary drink and measuring two hours later), skin thickness is the result of a skinfold thickness test taken at the triceps (upper arm), Insulin is the insulin concentration in the blood taken at the same time as the glucose measurement (Insulin is a hormone that transports glucose into cells), BMI is “Body Mass Index”, Diabetes Pedigree Function is a measure of diabetes risk based on the family history of diabetes for each patient (this is an engineered feature) and outcome is equal to 1 if the patient was diagnosed with diabetes with 5 years and 0 otherwise.\n\nSkim should show no missing data, but should indicate potential data issues. Do any of the percentile ranges (p0, p25, p50, p75, or p100) for the reported variables suggest a potential problem?\nFurther investigate the dataset to find potentially problematic variables using a qq-plot (geom_qq) or group_by combined with count and arrange. For which variables do you find repeated values and what are those values? Do you believe these values represent real measurements or could they correspond to missing data? Do the repeated variables occur in the same rows or different rows?\n\nWrite an overview of which values are missing and replace all missing values with NA for the next stage of analysis.\n\nPerform Tukey Box plots on each variable to identify potential outliers. Which variables have the most outliers? Are there any outliers that you think come from measurement error? If so remove them.\n\nProblem 2: Pair Plots\n\nUse the GGally package and its function ggpair on both the original dataset and the cleaned dataset. Which correlations change the most? What are the strongest correlations between variables overall and with the Outcome?\nLLM Prompting Exercise: Pair plots can often format poorly. Look at your pair plot and identify any deficiencies, which could be issues with legibility of variable names, axis labels, or the visibility of the visual elements itself. Try to see if you can improve some of these issues using an LLM of your choice. Report which LLM you used and what prompt you gave in addition to showing the changes to the figure.\nRemark: This dataset has been used as a model dataset for the construction of binary classifiers using machine learning and there are a large number of published studies showing these analyses. However, many of these analyses did not exclude the missing values erroneously coded as zero, as is discussed in this interesting paper by Breault, leading to highly degraded accuracy."

    "text": "Part 2: Car Crashes in NYC\nProblem 3: Finding Inliers and Missing Data\nLoad the NYC car crash dataset using read_csv. You can download the data from the course website by clicking here.\n\nWhich variables have missing data (use skim or another tool of your choosing)? Some missing values have a different interpretation than others- what does it mean when VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2 is missing compared to LATITUDE?\nLatitude and Longitude have the same number of missing values. Verify that they always occur in the same row. Check the counts of latitude and longitude values- do you find any hidden missing values? If so recode them as NA.\nMany of the geographic values are missing, but geographic information is redundant in multiple variables in the dataset. For example, with effort you could determine the borough of an accident from the zip code, the latitude and longitude, or the streets (not part of the assignment for this week). Consider the borough variable- what percentage of the missing values of borough have values present of at least one of zip code or latitude. What about if we include all the street name variables? What fraction of rows don’t have any detailed location information (latitude, zip code, or street names)?\nThe CRASH TIME variable has no missing values. Compute the count of how many times each individual time occurs in the crash data set. This will suggest that there are some inliers in the data. Compute summary statistics on the count data, and determine how many inliers there are (define an inlier as a data value where the count is an outlier, i.e. the count of that value is greater than 1.5*IQR + P75, i.e. 1.5 times the interquartile range past the 75th percentile for the distribution of counts for values of that variable.) For which inliers do you believe the time is most likely to be accurate? For which is it least likely to be accurate and why do you think so?\n\nProblem 4: Finding Patterns in the Data\nFormulate a question about crash data in NYC and make visualizations to explore your question. It could be related to the geographical distribution of accidents, the timing of accidents, which types of vehicles lead to more or less dangerous accidents, or anything else you want. Write comments/notes describing your observations in each visualizations you create and mention how these observations impact your initial hypotheses.\nUseful questions to consider when you observe a pattern (not all of them might apply to your case):\n\nCould this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?\nHow can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?\nHow strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?\nWhat other variables might affect the relationship?\nDoes the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?"

    "text": "In the this lab assignment, you are going to construct a social network from the characters in the book “Pride & Prejudice”, a novel written by Jane Austen and available in the janeaustenr package. The social network will be a weighted graph connecting the characters, where the weight is equal to the number of times the names of each character appeared in each 10 line section of the book. Once you create the graph, you will load it into tidygraph, make a visualization of the graph, and rank the most connected characters by a measure called degree centrality\nProblem 1\nLoad the text of Pride & Prejudice into R using the janeaustenr library. Then download and read pride_prejudice_characters.csv, the csv file from my github page containing a list of characters in Pride & Prejudice and their aliases. Here aliases refers to the different names that the characters go by in the books, for example “Darcy” also goes by the names “Mr. Darcy”, and “Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy” (not to be confused with his cousin “Colonel Fitzwilliam”).\nProcess the text of Pride & Prejudice to replace instances where an alias occurs with the full name of the character- I recommend using the iteration techniques you learned ealier, I arranged the order of names in the csv file to minimize misidentifications if you replace names in the order that they appear in the file. Making this perfect would require a bit of effort but we are ok if there are some misidentifications. Here the final name of each character will be a single word.\nProblem 2\nFollowing the example in chapter 4 of the text mining with R book, create a new column in the data frame corresponding to the Pride & Prejudice text that divides the text into sections of 10 lines each. Then use the pairwise_count function from widyr to determine the number of times each name occurs with each other name in the same 10 line section.\nProblem 3\nCreate a dataframe of nodes which contains the id and unique names of each character, and create a dataframe of edges which contains three columns: a column named from, a column named to, and a column named weight, where the from and to are the id numbers of each character and weight is the number of co-occurences you found in Problem 2. Each pair should only appear once in the edge list (i.e. Elizabeth and MrDarcy but not MrDarcy and then Elizabeth). Create a tidygraph object using tbl_graph that contains the social network data that we just constructed.\nProblem 4\nUsing ggraph, graph the connections between the characters. Make sure that each node is labeled by the character name, and make sure that the weight is represented by the thickness of the edge plotted between the two nodes. Then use the centrality_degree function to calculate the weighted degree centrality of each character, and make a plot which shows the degree centrality of each character where the characters are arranged in order of degree centrality."

    "title": "Lab 6: R and SQL",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nThis lab is divided into two parts. In the first part you will practice using joins for data wrangling and analysis on the nycflights dataset. Some of the problems come from Chapter 19 of your book. For the second part, you will download a dataset on the budgets of college sports programs and process it for storage in a relational database (I strongly recommend using duckdb which can be installed using install.packages(\"duckdb\")- duckdb is highly performant, self-contained, and ideally suited both to learning SQL and performing data analysis). Then you will load this database and use dbplyr to perform an analysis. You will also practice using forcats to recode some of the variables as factors (which are supported by duckdb) and using separate_wider_delim to split columns of text data.\nYou will need to have installed and to the following libraries:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(nycflights13)\n\n\n\nProblems\nPart I: Airline Flight Delays\nFor the first part of this lab exercise, we will be using the nycflights library, which contains several different built in datasets including planes, which has information on each plane that appears in the data; flights, which has information on individual flights; airports, which has information on individual airports; and weather, which has information on the weather that the origin airports. In order to do this set of lab exercises, you will need to use different types of joins to combine variables in each data frame.\nProblem 1\n\nUse the flights and planes tables to compute the mean departure delay of each aircraft that has more than 30 recorded flights in the dataset. Hint: Make note of the fact that the variable year appears in both flights and planes but means different things in each before performing any joins.\nUse anti-join to identify flights where tailnum does not have a match in plane. Determine the carriers for which this problem is the most common.\nFind the airplane model which made the most flights in the dataset, and filter the dataset to contain only flights flown by airplanes of that model, adding a variable which corresponds to the year each those airplanes were built. Then compute the average departure delay for each year of origin and plot the data. Is there any evidence that older planes have more greater departure delays?\n\nProblem 2\n\nCompute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:\n\n\nairports |&gt;\n  semi_join(flights, join_by(faa == dest)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +\n    borders(\"state\") +\n    geom_point() +\n    coord_quickmap()\n\nYou might want to use the size or color of the points to display the average delay for each airport.\nPart II: Creating and Accessing a Database \nIn this exercise we will begin with a flat file which contains data on college sports programs throughout the country. The source of the data is a government run database called Equity in Athletics Data Analysis, though we are working with just a small subset here. You can download this file by clicking here: sports_program_costs.csv. I have also included a data dictionary which gives a quick description of the dataset, which can be downloaded from here: sports_program_data_dictionary.qmd. This file contains information on two types of entities: sports teams and universities, however the information on both entities is combined into a single table, creating substantial redundancies. This exercise has several goals:\n\nLoad this data into R, split the dataframe into two dataframes, one corresponding to colleges and another corresponding to sports teams, related to each other by common keys. Many databases are stored according to normalization rules, which are designed to limit redundancy and to make it easier to both work with the data and make changes to it. By splitting the data frame we will partially normalize it (but won’t go too far).\nCreate a relational database using duckdb which contains these two tables.\nRead this database into R and a/an SQL query/queries to perform an analysis.\n\nProblem 3:\n\nsports_program_data.csv contains variables which either describe properties of a sports team or a college. Split sports_programs_data into two data frames, one called colleges and another called teams. How can you tell which variables describe colleges and which describe teams? Use the data dictionary and observations of how the values vary as you move from college to college to help make the decision easier. Make sure there are primary keys for both the colleges and teams data frames (verify with count)- what are the primary keys in each case and are they simple keys (one variable) or compound keys (require multiple variables). One of these data-sets should contain a foreign key- which one has it and what variables comprise it?\nThe variable sector_name contains information about whether a college is public, private, non-profit, for-profit, a 2-year college, or a 4-year + college. Split this variable (using separate_wider_delim) into two variables, one of which describes whether the college is a Public, Private nonprofit, or private for-profit, and another which describes how many years the college programs run.\nSeveral variables are candidates to be recoded as factors, for example state_cd, zip_text, classification_name, sports, and the sector variables you just created for the previous part. Recode these variables as categorical variables. For the classification variable, use the classification_code to order the factors according to the numeric code.\n\nProblem 4\n\nUsing DBI, duckdb, and dbplyr, create a relational database with two tables, writing the sports data frame you created in problem 3 to one and the colleges data frame (also from problem 3) to the other. Write this database to disk. How does the size of the database file compare to the original csv?\nUse dbplyr to write a query to this database that calculates the top 10 colleges ranked by the average profit (defined as revenue - expenses) of their american football team over the years of data. Print the SQL query that results from your R pipeline using show_query() and then use collect() to show the results of this query."

The dplyr vignettes and articles are incredibly useful for learning about all the different functions available\nWe will use the TTR package (which is part of the tidyquant family of packages, see here). The main function we will use is called runMean. An alternative package that is also very nice but not part of the tidyverse is RcppRoll\nIf you aren’t very comfortable with logarithms, you should read more about them. They are one of the most important mathematical functions for data science. We aren’t using their mathematical properties much this week but they will be important throughout your data science journey. Khan Academy has a decent video, and this article in the journal nature has some more context.\nWe will calculate some correlation coefficients, using the cor function from base R (?cor to see how it is used). There is also a tidyverse package called corrr that is useful for calculating correlations on data frames, but we won’t use it for this lab.\nThe motivation for today’s assignment came from some news articles a few years ago about how big tech stocks collectively had a miniature meltdown after powering the stock market for several consecutive years, see this article at Morningstar\nThe wikipedia page on Market Impact has some references to Kyle’s \\(\\lambda\\), which we will calculate this week.\n\nProblem 1: The price of a stock on a given day only conveys information in relation to the stock price on other days. One useful measure is the daily return of the stock, which we will define as the ratio of the adjusted closing price on the current day of trading to the adjusted closing price on the previous day of trading. Read the following article on window functions in dplyr: window functions in dplyr.\n\nDaily Return: Find a function there that will help you calculate the daily return and use it along with mutate to add a return column to the data frame containing the daily return.\n\nHint: make sure to use group_by(symbol), otherwise your calculation might transpose prices from a different stock at the beginning of each time series.\n\nFinding Special Events: Differences between the return and the return calculated based on the close price should indicate special corporate events such as dividends. Calculate the unadjusted return using the same technique you used to calculate the return, but replacing the adjusted variable with the close variable, and find the datapoint in the dataset where the return exceeded the unadjusted return by the greatest margin.\n\nHint to check you have done it right: it happened in November 2004. The reason that the close price and the adjusted price differ is because stock prices typically decrease when a dividend is paid (to account for the cash paid out). The adjusted value has been modified from the beginning of the initial data record to increase adjusted to compensate for dividends. A dividend is just a payment that a company makes periodically to those who hold stock.\nIf you are curious: Look for an old news article describing the significance of that event and tell me what happened\nProblem 2: When working with stock price fluctuations or other processes where a quantity increases or decreases according to some multiplicative process like a growth rate (for example population growth) it is often better to work with the log of the growth rate rather than the growth rate itself. This allows standard summary statistics such as the mean to have a useful interpretation (otherwise you would have to use the geometric mean). Furthermore, the log transform is often useful to use on variables that are strictly positive, such as population growth rates or daily stock returns. To see why, consider a hypothetical stock which had a return of 0.5 (50% loss) on one day and 1.8 on the next day (80% gain). The mean of these two returns would be 1.075, or 7.5% per day. However, at the end of the two day period the stock would have lost 10% of its value (0.5*1.8 = 0.9). If we had computed the mean of the log(return) instead, we would have found that (log(0.5)+log(1.8))/2 = log(0.9^(1/2)), or approximately -5.2% per day, matching the observed price change.\n\nDistribution of return Create a new variable called log_return which is the log of the return variable you calculated in the previous problem. Generate either a histogram or density plot of the distribution of log_return for the entire dataset. Then create a QQ-plot of log_return using geom_qq() and geom_qq_line(). What do you notice about the “tails” (right and left side/extreme edges) of the distribution from the QQ-plot? Are there visible signs of this in the density plot/histogram that you made?\n\nProblem 3: Volume measures how many shares were traded of a given stock over a set time period, and high volume days often associate with important events or market dynamics.\n\nVolume-Return Covariation: Create a new variable called log_volume which is the log(volume). Make a scatter plot of log_volume versus log_return, faceted by symbol to account for the fact that different stocks have different trading volumes. Do you see an association between log_volume and log_return in these scatter plots?\nVolume-Return Correlation: Use the cor function to compute the pearson’s correlation coefficient between log_volume and log_return for each symbol. Why do you think the correlations are close to 0?\n\nHint: use summarize and don’t forget that cor is a base R function so you will either need to filter NA values for volume and log_return or appropriately choose the use flag in the argument- see ?cor for more info.\n\nTransformed Correlations Next compute the correlation between abs(log_return) and log_volume using the absolute value function for each symbol. How have the correlations changed from the previous summary?\n\nProblem 4: For this problem we will implement a more complicated mathematical transformation of data by calculating a measure of liquidity for each stock.\nLiquidity measures the ability for a given asset to be bought or sold without a large impact on price. Liquid assets can be bought and sold quickly and easily (heavily traded stocks, currency), whereas illiquid assets (houses, art) have large increases or decreases in their price when someone tries to buy or sell them in large quantities. Liquidity is considered an important property of a well functioning financial market, and declines in liquidity have been blamed for worsening or triggering stock market crashes.\nMany methods have been invented to measure liquidity, but for this problem we will focus on a method called “Kyle’s \\(\\lambda\\)”. Kyle’s \\(\\lambda\\) estimates liquidity by using a linear regression between the absolute value daily return of a stock and the logarithm of the dollar volume of that stock. The time periods used to estimate this regression can vary (each choice of time periods defines a unique measure of liquidity), and here we will use daily returns and a one month time period (defined as 20 trading days). You will learn a lot about linear models in DATA 606 and other classes, but to be complete, \\(\\lambda\\) is a coefficient in the following linear model: \\[\n|R_t-1| = c + \\lambda \\log((\\mathrm{Volume})_t (\\mathrm{close})_t) + \\epsilon_t\n\\] where the coefficients \\(c\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) will be calculated to minimize the error \\(\\epsilon_t\\) over the past 20 trading days.\n\\(\\lambda\\) stands for the amount that the stock price will move in units of basis points for a given \\(\\log\\) dollar volume of trade. A small \\(\\lambda\\) indicates high liquidity, and a high \\(\\lambda\\) indicates low liquidity.\n\\(\\lambda\\) can be be calculated using rolling averages on the time series data with the TTR package, specifically the function runMean which when used within a dplyr pipeline will calculate the mean over the past \\(n\\) data points. For example, the command:\n\nlibrary(TTR)\nstocks |&gt; group_by(symbol) |&gt;  mutate(return_20d = runMean(return,n=20))\n\nadds a new variable which is equal to the mean of the log_return over the past 20 days. The mathematical formula for \\(\\lambda\\) is: \\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\mathrm{mean}_{20}(R_a\\log( p_c V ))\n- \\mathrm{mean}_{20}\\left(R_a\\right) \\mathrm{mean}_{20}\\left(\\log\\left(p_c V\\right) \\right) }\n{\\mathrm{mean}_{20}\\left(\\log\\left( p_c V \\right)^2\\right)\n-\\mathrm{mean}_{20}\\left(\\log(p_c V)\\right)^2 }\n\\] where to make the formula easier to read we have defined \\(R_a = |\\mathrm{return} -1|\\) (note this is the regular return and not log_return), \\(p_c = \\mathrm{close}\\) and \\(V = \\mathrm{volume}\\), and the averages have been taken over the past 20 days of data.\n\nCalculate Kyle’s \\(\\lambda\\): Add a new variable called kyle to the data frame by implementing the above formula for \\(\\lambda\\). Make sure to read and implement the formula very carefully, and to use the runMean function to calculate the rolling average correctly. I recommend writing a function which computes kyle from the variables close, return, and volume, and then using that function in mutate. You can start with the template code below (I would prefer you code this by hand):\n\n\nkyle = function(return,close,volume){\n  \n  # put your code here\n}\n\n\nVibe Liquidity- LLM Prompting Exercise: LLMs can be powerful tools for code generation, but they can introduce unexpected bugs and generate code that is difficult to read, understand, and maintain. As such, it is important to verify their output and to be very specific about the style and features you want the output code to have. Without direction, LLMs will recapitulate the style of their training set. Recreate the kyle function above using an LLM of your choice by prompting it with instructions about the style you want and the mathematical formula. How does the output differ from the function you constructed in part (a)? Test the function by comparing it to kyle function you created earlier on the same output. Make sure to tell me the prompt that you used and the LLM as well.\nLiquidity in Extreme Events: Add a new variable to the dataframe called extreme which is true when the log_return for a given stock is either greater than 99% of other values of the log_return or less than 99% of all values of log_return. Use the percent_rank dplyr window function along with logical operators to create this variable. Then for each stock calculate the mean value of Kyle’s \\(\\lambda\\) for the days when the log_return had extreme values and for when it didn’t (as identified by the extreme variable). What do your calculations and figures indicate about liquidity during extreme events?"

The dplyr vignettes and articles are incredibly useful for learning about all the different functions available\nWe will use the TTR package (which is part of the tidyquant family of packages, see here). The main function we will use is called runMean. An alternative package that is also very nice but not part of the tidyverse is RcppRoll\nIf you aren’t very comfortable with logarithms, you should read more about them. They are one of the most important mathematical functions for data science. We aren’t using their mathematical properties much this week but they will be important throughout your data science journey. Khan Academy has a decent video, and this article in the journal nature has some more context.\nWe will calculate some correlation coefficients, using the cor function from base R (?cor to see how it is used). There is also a tidyverse package called corrr that is useful for calculating correlations on data frames, but we won’t use it for this lab.\nThe motivation for today’s assignment came from some news articles a few years ago about how big tech stocks collectively had a miniature meltdown after powering the stock market for several consecutive years, see this article at Morningstar\nThe wikipedia page on Market Impact has some references to Kyle’s \\(\\lambda\\), which we will calculate this week.\n\nProblem 1: The price of a stock on a given day only conveys information in relation to the stock price on other days. One useful measure is the daily return of the stock, which we will define as the ratio of the adjusted closing price on the current day of trading to the adjusted closing price on the previous day of trading. Read the following article on window functions in dplyr: window functions in dplyr.\n\nDaily Return: Find a function there that will help you calculate the daily return and use it along with mutate to add a return column to the data frame containing the daily return.\n\nHint: make sure to use group_by(symbol), otherwise your calculation might transpose prices from a different stock at the beginning of each time series.\n\nFinding Special Events: Differences between the return and the return calculated based on the close price should indicate special corporate events such as dividends. Calculate the unadjusted return using the same technique you used to calculate the return, but replacing the adjusted variable with the close variable, and find the datapoint in the dataset where the return exceeded the unadjusted return by the greatest margin.\n\nHint to check you have done it right: it happened in November 2004. The reason that the close price and the adjusted price differ is because stock prices typically decrease when a dividend is paid (to account for the cash paid out). The adjusted value has been modified from the beginning of the initial data record to increase adjusted to compensate for dividends. A dividend is just a payment that a company makes periodically to those who hold stock.\nIf you are curious: Look for an old news article describing the significance of that event and tell me what happened\nProblem 2: When working with stock price fluctuations or other processes where a quantity increases or decreases according to some multiplicative process like a growth rate (for example population growth) it is often better to work with the log of the growth rate rather than the growth rate itself. This allows standard summary statistics such as the mean to have a useful interpretation (otherwise you would have to use the geometric mean). Furthermore, the log transform is often useful to use on variables that are strictly positive, such as population growth rates or daily stock returns. To see why, consider a hypothetical stock which had a return of 0.5 (50% loss) on one day and 1.8 on the next day (80% gain). The mean of these two returns would be 1.075, or 7.5% per day. However, at the end of the two day period the stock would have lost 10% of its value (0.5*1.8 = 0.9). If we had computed the mean of the log(return) instead, we would have found that (log(0.5)+log(1.8))/2 = log(0.9^(1/2)), or approximately -5.2% per day, matching the observed price change.\n\nDistribution of return Create a new variable called log_return which is the log of the return variable you calculated in the previous problem. Generate either a histogram or density plot of the distribution of log_return for the entire dataset. Then create a QQ-plot of log_return using geom_qq() and geom_qq_line(). What do you notice about the “tails” (right and left side/extreme edges) of the distribution from the QQ-plot? Are there visible signs of this in the density plot/histogram that you made?\n\nProblem 3: Volume measures how many shares were traded of a given stock over a set time period, and high volume days often associate with important events or market dynamics.\n\nVolume-Return Covariation: Create a new variable called log_volume which is the log(volume). Make a scatter plot of log_volume versus log_return, faceted by symbol to account for the fact that different stocks have different trading volumes. Do you see an association between log_volume and log_return in these scatter plots?\nVolume-Return Correlation: Use the cor function to compute the pearson’s correlation coefficient between log_volume and log_return for each symbol. Why do you think the correlations are close to 0?\n\nHint: use summarize and don’t forget that cor is a base R function so you will either need to filter NA values for volume and log_return or appropriately choose the use flag in the argument- see ?cor for more info.\n\nTransformed Correlations Next compute the correlation between abs(log_return) and log_volume using the absolute value function for each symbol. How have the correlations changed from the previous summary?\n\nProblem 4: For this problem we will implement a more complicated mathematical transformation of data by calculating a measure of liquidity for each stock.\nLiquidity measures the ability for a given asset to be bought or sold without a large impact on price. Liquid assets can be bought and sold quickly and easily (heavily traded stocks, currency), whereas illiquid assets (houses, art) have large increases or decreases in their price when someone tries to buy or sell them in large quantities. Liquidity is considered an important property of a well functioning financial market, and declines in liquidity have been blamed for worsening or triggering stock market crashes.\nMany methods have been invented to measure liquidity, but for this problem we will focus on a method called “Kyle’s \\(\\lambda\\)”.

    "text": "Research on LLMs in Education\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIn the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory – systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval, error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning phenomena such as “grokking” and the neuroscience of overlearning and intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models – biological “schemata” and neural manifolds – that enable users to evaluate, refine, and guide AI output…."

    "text": "Overview and Deliverables\nThis week is about meeting the other students, making sure you get a good start with required course software, and taking a bird’s eye view at data science workflows and the material that we will cover in the rest of the course. As such, the only official required assignments that you must turn in are to make a post on course Brightspace page introducing yourself, and to complete the meetup reflection (this is the same thing as the 1 minute papers of Data 606 if you are also taking that course). Howeer, you should also read the introduction posts of your classmates, perform the readings, and make sure to follow the tutorials and install the required software. Start early if you can with the software so we can sort out any issues asap. I’ll be monitoring the course slack page, which is the place where we will have most of our asynchronous communication during the course.\n\n08/25: Attend the initial course meetup at 6:45PM Eastern\nDue 9/01: Introduction Post in Brightspace Discussions\nSign up for GitHub and the course Slack channel\nComplete the readings of RDS (Intro and 28), the quarto tutorial, and up to section 15 in the happygitwithr tutorial\nInstall R, RStudio, git, etc (see the software page for more details\nSign up using the doodle poll for your data science in context presentation.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nData Science Workflow\nCourse Toolkit: R, RStudio, tidyverse, Quarto, git\n\n\n\nReadings\n\nRDS (R for Data Science): Introduction, Chapter 28\n\nThe Introduction chapter will describe the workflow of a typical data science project and pave the road for the rest of the material we are covering in this course. Chapter 28 describes the quarto markdown language, which a flexible system for authoring projects and presentations that produces well typeset documents in a variety of file formats and integrates with a large number of different programming languages, so that computations and their results can be directly embedded and visualized in your documents. I suggest that you use quarto to create your homework assignments.\n\nQuarto tutorial\n\nThis is an official quarto tutorial.\n\nHappy Git and GitHub for the R User: Tutorial up through Section 15\n\nGit is a tool that allows a group of people to work together on a software project, enabling version control that allows differences to be more easily resolved. GitHub is a repository for software projects that integrates well with Git. Git is a commonly used tool, and is almost a requirement for teams with large codebases and more than a few people working on them. GitHub has almost been like the “LinkedIn” for Data Scientists and Software Developers. One of the goals of this degree program is to help you build a portfolio of work on GitHub that you can use to demonstrate your coding proficiency to potential employers. These tools can be intimidating because they have a steep learning curve, so I think it is important to start introducing them slowly, at the very start. There are many ways to interact with Git and GitHub, but this excellent book by Jenny Bryant focuses on the specific case of a Data Scientist working in R and RStudio. If you already know Git and have a good system, you aren’t required to follow this tutorial, but for those of you who are new to these tools this I recommend taking some time this week to get Git up and running and integrated with your RStudio installation.\n\nData Visualization: A Practical Introduction Appendix A1: How to Read an R Help File\n\nThis is another excellent resource on learning R, but the reading I’ve suggested here is an appendix which discusses the structure of help files. Being able to use help files successfully is a skill that separates novice and intermediate programmers from experienced ones, as help files often have a very formal structure that doesn’t read like a normal text document or piece of writing. This section can you know what to expect and how to get what you need from them instead of feeling frustrated.\n\n\nVideos\nHadley Wickham Introduces the Tidyverse\nThis course uses something called the tidyverse. The tidyverse is a series of packages that replaces much of the functionality of base R while at the same time giving the resulting R code a very different flavor. This course, and many of the courses in this program, start by jumping right into the tidyverse. This video provides an introduction to the tidyverse from one of its main creators. However, while this decision has some initial benefits, it isn’t without tradeoffs, so it is important for you to keep in mind that there are other, different ways to do things in R. We will explore some of these later in the class in the Big Data module and the Advanced R programming module.\nIf you want to read a little bit more about the trade offs of the different R ecosystems this is a short link:\nR Comparisons\nSpeaking with colleagues, the choice to use base R versus the tidyverse is quite polarizing, especially as you work in more complex projects.",

Selecting, cleaning, constructing, integrating, and formatting data.\n\n\n\nHow is this course relevant for data analytics professionals?\nMost data analytics professionals spend most of their time getting data and preparing it for analysis. This is the course that teaches these key skills, as we work with both structured and unstructured data.\n\n\nGrading\n\nMeetup Reflections (10%)\nLabs (50%)\nTidyVerse Recipes\nData Science in Context Presentation (5%)\nProject (25%)\n\n\nGrade Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality of Performance\nLetter Grade\nRange %\nGPA\n\n\n\n\nExcellent - work is of exceptional quality\nA\n93 - 100\n4\n\n\nExcellent\nA-\n90 - 92.9\n3.7\n\n\nGood - work is above average\nB+\n87 - 89.9\n3.3\n\n\nSatisfactory\nB\n83 - 86.9\n3\n\n\nBelow Average\nB-\n80 - 82.9\n2.7\n\n\nPoor\nC+\n77 - 79.9\n2.3\n\n\nPoor\nC\n70 - 76.9\n2\n\n\nFailure\nF\n&lt; 70\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow This Course Works\nThis course is conducted entirely online. Each week, you will have various resources made available, including weekly readings from the textbooks and occasionally additional readings provided by the instructor. Most weeks will have homework assignments and labs to be submitted (although some chapters will take more than one week, see the schedule for details). There will also be a presentation required and a forum post introduction required. You are expected to complete all assignments by their due dates.\nYou are expected to attend or watch every Meetup. I highly recommend attending the Meetups live if possible but understand that may not be possible for everyone. Recordings will be made available by the next morning on the Meetups page. In addition to highlighting key concepts from each learning module, some topics will be discussed that are not in the textbook. Moreover, we regularly make announcements in the Meetups that will be important to being successful in this course. At the end of each Meetup there will be a short reflective exercise. These will contribute to your participation grade.\nEach students will have to complete one short “Data Science in Context Presentation”- you will sign up for presentation times at the beginning of the semester.\nThe culmination of the course will be the presentation of the analysis of a dataset of your choosing. See the project for more information.\n\n\nTextbooks and Course Materials\n\nR for Data Science (2e) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. This is the primary text for the course. Available online for free at: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/\nHappy Git and GitHub for the userR, Jennifer Bryan. Available online for free at happygitwithr.com/.
