B0001DUD9O,"This yarn has hot pink tones through maroon tones. It is darker than what is pictured, in general. The picture shows some pale pink areas, but none of the yarn has any pale tones. And the picture depicts more dusty rose tones, and the actual colors are mostly very deep or vibrant, with no dusty rose shades at all in it. There is more maroon than pink. I would say that it is misnamed, and would be closer to red tones, rather than pink tones. It's not a bad combination, it's just not what I expected, given the picture and the name. . Over priced . splits hard to use on my knitting loom . Wrong item description! It is stated that it is 364 yards and when received it the yarn is 244 yard. This is overpriced for the yardage. WalMart has 244 yards for $2.50 . I liked the product but have discoverd it was wsyyyyy overpriced!!! . The pumpkin color is more tangerine then what is shown in the preview.  Would be nice if they had a more true to color picture. . I have it an okay rating. It's good yarn but a bit on the pricey side for the size. I', making a blanket & almost done the yarn now & will need lots more. It's machine washable & study though. . This yarn should not be called ""glow"" anything.  It is misleading.  I would not have purchased it had I known it does not glow. . I ordered orange, but received coral. . I have bought this yarn previously (Aran) and was satisfied.  I recently bought two skein and found them totally flawed.  Consistanly varied as to the width, the twist and one skein was knotted twice.  I will never again purchase Red Heart 4 ply again.  Where was the quality control?
On to another brand.

B000B7Q9KM,"Came out peach on plain white tshirts. Followed the directions completely. Terrible. . Color does not transfer well . The liquid it easy to use (rather than the rit powder) . Color came of after a couple of wear . Sadly I received this and it was royal blue. It was a dark color put it in the wash and it was almost navy..... . Well, anyone who has read my scathing review of ""taupe"" can now continue the saga here. I am trying to dye something a very specific shade of beige, for reasons I will not go into. I went with taupe first, based on the sample photo, and it was NOT accurate. Next I went with TAN. I would still say that the sample photo is somewhat misleading, but it was at least closer than the other. I believe that if I mix it with some white it might turn out closer to the right color. At least theres no green tint. . I used this on white cotton and it came out red. It certainly doesn't look like the color on the container. . Color faded quite a bit after washing. . Denim blue makes everything purple, not blue.
Not blue-ish purple either, it's pure purple. I followed the instruction in the washing machine and everything is nice purple.
White cotton hat, white cotton tank tops and t shirts all purple.

Cocoa brown is perfectly brown. Nice color. . This dye does not dissolve in hot water well and creates uneven dyed clothes."
B000WURGNC,"Love the variety of sizes, but the needles keep unscrewing while I am knitting and the needles themselves don't say the size so if you place them in the wrong spot in the case, you can mistakingly use the wrong needle, especially the smaller ones. . I received these needles as a Christmas present which I specifically asked for. How great to have every possible size circular needle I could ever want all in one place! I was extremely excited to try them. My hopes were soon dashed when I pulled the needles/cables out of the package.

The needles themselves are of great quality and pretty colors as others have noted. However, the cables are so incredibly STIFF it is nearly impossible to knit anything small on the smallest size. Also, the bend at the join is so terribly rigid it extends the ""needle"" making it very hard to knit anything small. I also had to keep re-screwing the needles to the cable which I found extremely frustrating. I am hoping they will possibly work better on larger scale products as they are unable to be returned to the store where they were purchased since it is now an open item. I say save your money and just buy the needles singly as you need them as this is NOT worth the hassle.

One other note for anyone else who is experiencing these issues: I did find this link which seems to provide a nice tutorial on how to make your own cables for this particular set. You can find it here: [...] . Come unscrewed very very often and the cords are very rigid. I've had them about a year and I'm ready to pitch them and move on. If you don't knit often, or are new and not sure you want to spend the money for decent needles yet, these are passable and will work in a pinch. It will make the next needles you buy seem like a dream. . My first set of interchangeable knitting needles were the Denise brand.... plastic needles and plastic connecting parts.  They kept disconnecting while I worked with them... completely unacceptable.  So, I purchased these aluminum needles thinking they would be better and stronger.  One use, they also disconnected!  Second use, I used their included tools, a gripper and a key (similar to an unbent paperclip) to tighten them.  The female end of the needle fanned out of shape when I tightened it!  Size no. 8, now useless because the needle will snag the yarn!  Third use, size 2 for a pair of mittens, the blob of plastic on the wire connecting to the male screw piece is bigger than the needle.  So all the work must remain on the needle and cannot be moved down onto the wire!  Just very disappointed and now in the market for another set!  I cannot recommend these. . Horrible needle set. interchangeable needles are useless because it dislodges frequently causing the yarn to unravel! save your money and instead buy ""ADDI TURBO"" needles which make knitting much faster and does not dislodge!!!! . The cords are not as easy to bend as I would like them to be.  I had to file some plastic from the end of one that was catching on thread.  These things caused me to be slightly unsatisfied with the product. . Love all the needles included in this set, but beware, the cable lengths advertised are not what are included in the package.  They are much, much shorter. . I was knitting a blanket in the round, it didn't even get to lap size before the size 5 needle just snapped at the threading, lost a bunch of my stitches. I'm not an ""aggressive"" knitter and I've never broken interchangeable needles before. It was extremely frustrating, I don't trust the rest of the set now and the size 5 is my favorite anyway. . If you are serious about knitting, go with ChiaoGoo or Auddi Click. I watched youtube reviews to see the products in action before I invested $100-$150 on a set of needles.

HOWEVER, if you plan to purchase these as a gift for a young child or new knitter, I highly recommend them. They are great for beginners. . In total I like Needlemaster 40-Piece Interchangeable Aluminum Knitting Set, but I have problems with cables lengths: they are NOT true to size. The matter is that in description on site of Amazon and also on the package of the set were mentioned following cable lengths: 20-inch, 24-inch, 29-inch and 36-inch, but  in fact I have got cable lengths: 12-inch, 14-inch, 16-inch and 21-inch. I was very disappointed. I would like to be informed about the right lengths before purchasing. Now Im looking for the required lengths, but Boye offers only lengths: 12-inch, 14-inch, 16-inch and 21-inch. Maybe any other manufactures  cables are suitable for the Boye set? Please, advice."
B000Y00DDK,"This yarn isn't as nice looking at the picture, but it's good enough for the price.  I am familiar with the brand so I knew what to expect.  On the other hand, it's a nice color and it's easy to wash and care for. . This is usely a good yarn for price. I pitched 3. The first one was really nice when I started on my blanket. Half way through it was not twisted as well as at the beginning but still it was fine. The other two was separating and catching on the crochet hook. I was making a baby blanket but because of the separating of the yarn I decided to make it a smaller blanket for my grandaughters dolls. I would not buy this again because of the time you lose when it splits on the hook and the stitches are not always smooth. . Wrong item description! It is stated that it is 364 yards and when received it the yarn is 244 yard. This is overpriced for the yardage. WalMart has 244 yards for $2.50 . Ok but I wish it was more soft but I like it  , the color was. Nice every body like it . I am just learning to crochet and selected this yarn because it had great reviews, the skein was large and the price was low. The color is as vibrant and wonderful as the picture would lead you to believe, and the skein really is huge given the low price. I figured this would be a great yarn to learn and practice on. However, I think this product is for those who have a lot more experience working with yarn than I do. The yarn kept splitting apart. Very often my hook would go through the yarn itself, instead of through the stitch, causing catches and knots in my work. I found this very frustrating and it slowed me down a lot. Finally I gave up and passed this yarn on to a friend who is a lot more experienced than I am. The yarn is beautiful, but a nightmare for beginners like me. (Plus, it's on the scratchy side; it squeaked pretty loudly against the needles.) I recommend Lion's Brand yarns instead. They are somewhat pricier (and the skeins are usually much smaller), but I found that yarn to be much easier to work with.

P.s. - If you go to a specialty site dedicated to yarn crafts, like Love Knitting, Red Heart is pretty low down on the list of ""most loved"" worsted weight yarns. Not a good sign. . I'm fairly new to crocheting.  I ordered the banana berry color to make my niece a blanket.  As a lot of others have said, it is sort of a rough textured yarn and slightly more bulky than your typical medium weight yarn,  It does stitch up nice though and having bought this multi colored yarn it makes it much easier to see the stitches as you're working.  The colors are super cute. When I finish with the blanket,  I will wash it up and add some fabric softener.  I'm sure it will be super soft after that. . Thinner than other RHSS yarns I have used in the past but the colorway worked up beautifully. . Just  be warned.  This ""Oatmeal"" is really a light steel gray. It's no Oatmeal I've ever seen. . It really took a long time to get here. Found what we needed at a local store to complete the project. . Has a terrible feel"
B000YQG9ZK,"Got one that just split on me - the hairs could not be put back to a fine point and it was only used twice. . Wrong size.  I wanted size 1, don't know why I was sent size 6...need to return. . After everyone telling me ""this is THE brush you need for miniatures"", I bought one. What a waste of money. It's soft. Only slightly springier than camel hair and holds a tip just as poorly. I've spent two weeks conditioning the brush everyday with masters trying to lock into a nice tip. It can only hold a tip for about three strokes. I spend more time fiddling with the brush than painting.

The most expensive brush I own will now be regulated to the only thing it can do well. Drybrush. . This brush is brand new and useless. It does not hold a point and fans out almost immediately. I am not sure if these are genuine or not because I have other Series 7 and they have been solid for years. I am seriously disappointed and would NOT buy these again. . Really pretty unhappy with the brush.  Tended to split right away.  After talking with other painters, Winsor Newton 7's may have a quality control issue.  Some are very good, but some are just junk.  My offbrand cheap Walmart brushes were better.  I picked up a Rosemary & Co brush for about 1/2 the price and it was so, so, so much better. . The tip splits in half. I've used master's soap to try and retrain it, but it just doesn't feel like the WN Kolinsky brushes I've purchased before. If the price seems too good to be true. . . . Excelent . According to the picture, I thought I was buying a whole set of brushes, but I only received one brush. I know very little about paint brushes and was buying this for someone else. Just be aware the price is for one brush only. . These brushes come very highly recommended, but my first one was not very good. I've only used it twice and I have loose hairs that won't go away and the brush is already forked. I'm no novice to painting miniatures, I made absolutely sure not to get paint in the ferrule. Extremely disappointed considered how much I paid for this brush. . I want to ask people interested in sable brushes (no matter which brand) to please consider synthetic sable instead because the hair used in these brushes is gotten by extremely cruel means. Please research this for yourselves. Thank you."
B000YQGA4K,"Just started water coloring for my journal and I'm not that familiar with painting or paint brushes but I think I need a small size  like this but a bit stiffer, which I'm not sure it is made like that. . Excelent . I waited for more then a month and when it finally arrived i was pretty excited. I opened the box and what do you know? light bulbs!!
not planning on waiting so ill just use these light bulbs to paint with my winsor watercolor set. . This brush is brand new and useless. It does not hold a point and fans out almost immediately. I am not sure if these are genuine or not because I have other Series 7 and they have been solid for years. I am seriously disappointed and would NOT buy these again. . I've been painting for 18 years, and can say when you get a GOOD version of this brush type, it will be the best brush you've ever owned. However, of the last three purchases of this brush, two of them have been poorly made. A brush should not splay and fishtail on day-1 of use (and this is with highly diluted acrylic paints mind you). Due to the extremely poor quality control at Winsor & Newton, I will permanently be switching to the Raphael 8404 brush series.

If you opt to buy one of these brushes, be prepared to make returns until you receive one in good condition. . Good thing, but almost 1 month shipping time is way too long... . These brushes come very highly recommended, but my first one was not very good. I've only used it twice and I have loose hairs that won't go away and the brush is already forked. I'm no novice to painting miniatures, I made absolutely sure not to get paint in the ferrule. Extremely disappointed considered how much I paid for this brush. . Wonder if I was ripped off here--No where does it say Kolinsky brushes except on the box.  The round 8 is already losing hairs andw hold a point. . Bought a size 00 for painting miniatures bristles are bent and do not hold to a point. I've got better brushes from a 10 pack for $8 than this single brush, supposedly the best, for $14. Absolute trash. . I bought two sizes and this one also has a problem with the tip splitting in half. I've heard of this problem, just never gotten one myself. I figured that extremely low price had to mean it was a gamble. Just not a top quality WN Kolinsky."
B000YZ8N6Y,"I think this is a good idea!  However I have not yet used it.  It is not recommended for machines that have a computer, for obvious reasons.  Because I am not sure if my machine is computerized,  I have not used it.  My Singer is not a fancy one but it does have 60 styles of stitching.  So if I find that my machine is not computerized, I will add to my review. . Product is ok. . Seems to work well.  Will have to use it more to make a complete assesment of its real value.  Would probably recommend it to a friend. . Couldn,t use it . Read a review that stated this could be used with a computerized sewing machine. Thought it would be small then.  It is not. Brother did not seem to think it safe either. There are a hundred and one ways to mark a seam line and most all would be safer than this. No need to take a chance with the cost of machines. . just ok for me... . You need a fairly big metal bobbin plate guard for this to actually work. It is apt to slide if the whole guide doesn't fit on the metal plate. . Not happy with this. I thought this wasn't supposed to move while sewing to help guide, but even though its magnetic, it slides. Waste of money. . I did not like this.  It scratches my machine and gets in the war unless you are sewing a long straight seam.  Not a fan and will prolly not use it much.  Mole skin on the machine is cheaper and better. . returned as cannot use with computerize machine"
B001144TXI,"I bought this latch hook kit for my granddaughter who has never done any latch hooking at all. This kit is a small size & it doesn't have the pattern printed on the canvas. I really liked that because the first time I tried to work a latch hook kit on a printed canvas I got all messed up with it. You would think that it would be easier to work on a printed canvas but I found that the un-printed canvas was so much easier. This canvas has the squares printed on it in blue so you just count the little squares to find where your yarn needs to go. It is simple & small, great for a first time latch hooker. I wish that each kit would also include the latch hook tool but none of them do so you have to buy your latch hook tool separate. I didn't like the fact that the yarn was not separated, that chore we had to do ourselves & that was time consuming which had to be done before the kit could be started. I would of given it 4 stars if the yarn had been separated & I would of given it 5 stars if the yarn was separated & it had included the latch hook tool. But although I only gave it 3 stars I still really liked this kit, I just didn't like the extras I had to deal with in order to work this kit. . As with the other Wonderart Latch Hook Kit, this one was disappointing.  There are supposed to be 40 rows across.  As I'm working the rug, I noticed my count of colors was off.  I counted, recounted, took out the yarn & started over.  The actual rug is only 39 rows.  If I had not caught the difference, I would have run out of yarn near the end.  I don't feel Wonderart is very good with their products (counting difficulties).  I probably would not purchase any more products from them . Cute but the product finished isn't distinctly a cat!  Colors are too much a like! . Be aware there is no latch  hook in this ""kit"" and the weaving canvass is blank.  Not good for children under 10 . The image of the cupcake is NOT on the hatch hook grid.  Major thumbs down . It wasn't what I thought, as a kid I had one of these but the picture was on the rug all you had to do was follow the colors thats why I bought this for my 7 year old but I guess they don't come like that anymore. . Way to hard for any child under the age of 10.. . Be aware no hook included and the pattern is not printed on the wearing canvas so not the best item for children under 10 . It wasn't what I thought, as a kid I had one of these but the picture was on the rug all you had to do was follow the colors thats why I bought this for my 7 year old but I guess they don't come like that anymore. . is not easy for a kid"
B00114OO10,"I have small hands and I couldn't get this to stay on.  The yarn would just slip through the hole and pull it off my finger.  The edge of the spring is also sharp. . I would recommend this with someone who is active knitter. . Didn't fit me, and awkward. . Is too big for my fat fingers, disappointed that it slides right off. . I have arthritis and was disappointed that it s not adjustable. So it is if no use to me cause it won't fit over any of my fingers . Interesting . Not sure how to use it...no directions included . I found this awkward because the two yarn loops were at such odd angles.  Also, it didn't really fit my index finger, too small.  I finally made my own with a piece of wide elastic and a couple of safety pin like stitch markers.  My DIY works great, fits great and I had the fixins in my sewing box so it didn't cost anything.  Thanks for the idea though. . I THOUGHT THIS COULD BE FOR CROCHETERS ALSO  TO PREVENT SCRATCHES FROM THE YARN ON THE FINGERS BUT IS NOT.. MUST ONLY BE A GUIDE FOR KNITTERS. TOO BAD THAT INFO. DO NOT SHOW ON THE SITE OR PACKAGE. . Takes practice to use right! Just FYI"
B00122CN64,"Nice, but surprosed it was so small, especially for a medium brush.  Would be nice if a little larger brush head for medium and larger water holding tank. . I returned this product as soon as I opened it. I thought it would add to my watercolor supplies; but was disappointed. When they describe mini-colors, they mean mini. Not even 1/2 pans. I decided I could better spend that same money on a set of  ""Pentel Arts Aquash Water Brushes"". . I'm giving these only a 3 simply because they are so chalky and pale compared to the cotman set. I did some color mixing and compared this set to cotman and there is no comparison in the richness of the pigments. I painted out a color chart for the cotmans as well and the only advantage I see for the Koi is that is contains a purple and you have to mix it on the smallest cotman set. Purples and nice greens are harder to mix in these student sets so it may be better to have one already in your palette - but I would suggest the larger Cotman set with 16 colors. It's a little more expensive, but the colors are much, much better. Neither compare to mixing my Daniel Smith colors, but for their price range that's not a fair comparison! If, however, you want to invest in higher quality paints, I highly recommend DS - very clear, rich colors even when mixed. . These are often recommended a good starter student set of watercolors. Hense why I bought it. I've learned a little since then and now know that I could get better products for nearly the same price. If I was starting again I'd buy a Mission Gold 24 set of tube colors. They're affordable, very saturated pigments, and artist quality.

Regarding the Koi set, they have half pans (the cups holding the paint) which are annoying to get color into brushes because the pan is so small its hard to pickup with a brush thats longer than the pan. The pallet is not reusable, you cannot remove the pans so they're difficult to clean. Some of the colors have heaved and cracked from wetting and drying repeatedly (as watercolors do). The colors seem to not be vibrant although thats just what you get with student grade colors. I found the water brush cumbersome to use. Prefer real brushes. . This is great for first timers I guess but in general the quality isn't very good. The paints are really bad quality that I am scraping them out and filling the palette in with my own watercolors. Also, the water filled brush is extremely hard to use, renedering it useless. The only thing I was kind of happy with were the sponges because I thought that was pretty clever, although they do get dirty pretty quickly. Instead of these, I reccomend buying your own aluminum palette and filling it with some shinhan watercolors. . It was ok but much smaller than I expected. . If the water brush was better, I'd give it 4 stars.  My main disappointment was how small it was - my fault for not paying closer attention to this before purchase.  The colours are nice but not great but there is ample mixing space.  The water brush is - leaks too much water - when you press it and leaks water when you're not pressing it.
All in all, I was expecting higher quality paint; they are too opaque and a bit chalky.  But for my skill level, they will do until I get better at watercolour painting. . Came without a paint brush tip so it was useless unless you went and bought another set of the paint pens (or used QA-Tips). . Well, I purchased this as an alternate to my Niji water brush that I have used for a few years and love. I thought I'd try a different brand. As yet I haven't tried it and I admittedly went with the Sakura brand name given that I use the Micron pens in my art and they have always worked well for me. Out of the package it appears kind of cheaply made and it's rather small, in my opinion. I understand that it is supposed to be a ""travel"" brush but so is my Niji which is significantly longer and better made.

Pros: I suppose it's as advertised. I haven't tried it out yet and am not currently able to.

Cons: Top is reverse threaded. States ""do not lose black cap"", which is small and (in my opinion) unnecessary anyway, but there's really no place to keep it. The cap is supposedly for separating the two halves for travel, so that the tank doesn't leak. It just feels poorly made and the cap that's supposed to go on the back of the brush for added length (I guess? Still shorter than my Niji by a lot) doesn't seem to attach all that firmly.

I probably wouldn't purchase this again but I will keep it and try it out. I suspect I'll be more happy with the Niji I own and have used for watercolor for a few years now. I'll also probably buy another Niji next time. . I bought this pen as a replacement for the pen that came with my  Koi Sakura watercolor set- my parrot ate it for lunch. The pen that came with that set was great. This is the same quality, but the barrel is about a thrid smaller at least. Its shorter than most pens so it's a bit awkward. I'm pretty disappointed in the size. I wish I could just buy another barrel!"
B0012WAE24,"Thought more were supposed come than what I  received. Had a few broken and chipped beads. They are really pretty though. . These arrived with many beads missing.  The envelope had no padding and the plastic pouch inside was torn and smaller beads missing.  Very disappointing.
Color was NOT at all like photo.  Nothing vibrant about the colors.  Not recommended at all. . Not the pretty striated beads in the packet, mostly solid colors.  VERY FEW BEADS at all and certainly not as pictured!  Per bead, extremely expensive. . you will always get what you pay for . The beads themselves were very nice.  I did not receive enuf of one color to use as anything.  Thank you . I received a very small bag of beads that should cost about $ 3.00 at the most.  don't bother with these,  not worth it. . kinda weird . Beads are okay but was excepting to receive more than I received . didn't like or use them. . wish there were more duplicates...I specialize n crafting  ""geen art jewelry"",  especial earrings.  Cod use more  ""pairs in selection currently offered"
B0013JRFUA,"This medium weight chipboard would not cut shapes with my dies and Cuttlebug. It fed through, in fact back and forth several times, but chipboard was just too thick for the thin dies. Will have to find something thinner. . Just received this today.  I expected both sides to be white - but only one side is white, the other side is brown.  I needed white board on both sides.  I even paid for 1-day shipping on this. Very disappointed. . I didn't know this was so thick i can't  cut it.  i should have returned it but will find a use somewhere. . I purchased this same product in February. However, the quality of the chipboard is much thinner and I will need to double the chipboard to make it equal to my February purchase. I am disappointed. . The product was fine, it just was not what I thought it would be. Too much trouble to return. . This medium weight chipboard would not cut shapes with my dies and Cuttlebug. It fed through, in fact back and forth several times, but chipboard was just too thick for the thin dies. Will have to find something thinner. . I bought this to use in my Cricut and Cuttlebug. It is way too heavy to use in the Cuttlebug. I am afraid to try it with my Cricut. I can't imagine if this is medium weight what the heavy is like. I had never bought chipboard before and I bought the wrong thing for what I wanted. . Ok . I thought I was getting WHITE chipboard and it's more a creme color. Yes it says white. And only one side is finished in white the other is natural. The board is what I wanted but I also expected a slicker surface on at least the one white side. I didn't expect both sides not to be finished in white even though often you get one side that is more rough that would have been fine. It doesn't state two sided finished so guess it's on me. I ordered this same board in the black and the natural too. Natural and white came in same box...so far not the black. So I'm bracing for the black to also be only finished on one side. So they will work for book ends and calander supports for standing up etc. But not for the plans I intended..which were to cut into 3.5 or 4 inch squares for thick Zentangle squares...not unless I figure out how to glue good quality water color paper to the tiles finished or not yet. And also have not found a great source of black paper that's smooth for doing tangles in silver and white inks. I wanted a pure white for both black and brown ink work without having to re-surface or cover. It'll get used up...we make a lot of books and print off our manuals that come on disks so often these days too.
Also do have a pazzle cutter so will use some for cut outs. I might even make my own version of
a french curve for use on my tangles by cutting it via the pazzle and small enough to carry along
with my supplies. I know they make minature french curves but haven't located one recently. So perhaps I can spray paint the edges of my own cardboard version here to help hold up and stay smooth to use during drawings. . Ok"
B0014DGXU8,"Waste of $$$ don't work . plastic too hard. can't get it on with the ring already on. Getting it off so your ring will go over your knuckle is almost impossible. Totally not worth buying. Way overpriced for what it is. . The size I needed was smaller.  I placed the smallest on and thought that it would work and a couple hours after I noticed it was gone and the ring was turning around on my finger.  It may work for someone else better. . it is so fat I had to take it off . only work for thin rings . I have an expensive ring now and a problem that I'm sure many women face -- water retention, especially at certain times of the month.  The ring fits very well at times I'm retaining a lot of water, and is rather too large at other times.  Because my fingers are changing size a bit, it doesn't make sense to size the ring down.  But neither do I like it slipping left and right on my finger.  So I bought these.

These work as advertised.  I chose the smallest one.  It was a bit difficult to get on the ring, the first time (it helps to have the ring on your finger first), but it has gotten easier as I have taken it off and put it on again.  These are basically just short pieces of narrow-diameter Tygon or similar tubing, with slits cut in them.

Most of the time, when this is on, I don't feel it.  It's a bit of a problem when I want to do something like wash my hands or put on hand lotion; I don't like the way the slit in the tubing feels and it's a bit hard to dry my hands afterwards.  But it's clear and it doesn't bother me while I'm typing, which is what I do most of the day at work.

These were all different sizes and thicknesses and would suit a variety of rings.  I probably won't use the others, now that I've found one that fits.  But they are there if I'm interested.  And now my ring isn't slipping around on my hand.  I just wish they were a little easier to put on and more comfortable during hand washing. . This item rolls around the bottom and sides of the ring and bugs the heck out of me.  Not the greatest accomplishment guys.  Everything else has got to be better than this! . Don't really work well. Turn around a lot and fall off.  Do not recommend purchase.,! . Ridiculous, uncomfortable pieces of thick plastic tubing. . too big and bulky. does work, but not comfortable"
B00172XBQA,"I ordered a few different yarns from red heart, since i loved using them before. Sadly this time when i used them, the package was stolen off my porch and they refused to give me a refund or to resend me the yarn I ordered. Very disappointing. . I'm not a fan at all of this yarn. The tiny fibers are itchy and come out way too easily. . I can't believe this is even made. It is the most unpleasant feeling yarn I've ever felt. A total waste. . This yarn was the worst yarn I ever bought! It  kept separating and also cost twice as much at amazon then it does in a store. I ordered it because the store was out of it and I had a project I was working on. I thought for the price it was a bigger ball of yarn. [O . I only rated this 2 stars for the price. I just bought the same yarn. Same weight and length at Walmart for 2.77. That's half of the price they have it on here. . This yarn is very coarse. It was not nice to work with. The colors are play, but I hated crocheting with this. . its a pretty yarn but not what I ordered. I ordered purple tones and got the candy color. . Very small skeins, smaller than I expected  for the price but this was the only place I could find some more of the color I needed so I kept them. Wished the description had listed ounces since that's what I am used to working with. . Not as good a quality as some of the other Red Heart yarn, I have bought. . Th quality of the yaarn is exactly what you'd expect, however the color was not true to the picture. I expected the Baby Pink to be a normal soft pastel pink, but it is actually a bit bright and bordering on neon. The photo is a bit exaggerated, but you can see the slight orange undertones in it, which I did not want. It's good enough for what I had in mind, though."
B0017KYE5Y,"the product is just o.k. My wife uses it for her scrap booking. I guess the fact that it's not as sturdy is the reason we don't like it. Plus I'm not sure how long that small razor blade will last. In the end we ended up buying a guillotine style cutter. . If you are planning on cutting thick bond paper (~ 10 pieces a week) this portable scrapbook cutter is a good solution for the money. . I bought this paper cutter because most of the reviews were good, but, since then, my work has taken a turn for the worse.  After measuring very carefully on the cutter, the cuts that resulted were always different lengths.  I doubted myself; put on glasses, measured three times, etc.  Still wonky.  So I measured the paper in the paper cutter before I cut and discovered that it is 1--2 millimeters off.  When you're working with fine projects, as I do, that is a world of difference.  I own many good Fiskars cutting products, which is the other reason I bought this.  The price is good, another reason.  But I never would have bought it if it carried a warning that it was 1--2 mm off.  That's not worth it at any price. . my old one had a wire guide, this one doesn't  - same brand though so i'm not sure if i can find another one with the wire guide or not . It's okay. For the money, it isn't bad. Don't expect perfect lines or great build quality. . It's a trimmer. it functions properly. I was satisfied. . Peace of rubbish, it's not accurate and the orange cutter does not slide well, it pops out at the top, frustrating. From now on I'm going with Martha Stewart everything. I would love to return, but it's too late. . I did not buy mine from Amazon, but I bought one just like this, at a local craft story. It cut straight lines at first, at least I thought it did, but after having to change out the first blade, I started to notice all my cards did not align when I folded them. The Friskar was NOT cutting a straight line!!! It was slightly off to the side which was noticable when trying to alight mat layers and closing/folding my cards. I have to actually score all my paper FIRST, on an envelope score board and then match that line up on my Friskar's lines, in order to get a straight cut. It's VERY frustrating and almost worthless. I'm am now looking for something better. I just wish I had noticed this right away, and if it was something that happened after use, I knew what caused this. But for now, I cannot recommend this :(. . Pretty easy to use . Pretty easy to use"
B001QX2G9S,Not the best but it works . worked better than the royal blue but still didn't come out very strong and rinsed out first wash. . NOT what I thought petal pink was. I needed a light pink. This is very dark. I dyed the top half this dress. Sleeves and chest part.  It doesn't look horrible but that's not the pink I needed. Maybe it's the material? Either way it shouldn't be so dark . Fhe color is just awful. Not what I would call apple green. It was muddy green not crisp and spring like I imagined. Made for a barely passable Katerina Kittycat costume . Washes out quickly and bleeds. . pricey. . Color does not transfer well . This worked just as good as the powder. Not a uniform dye. I would not recommend this to anyone. I followed the instructions and it turned out almost like I was trying to tie dye the 3 onesies that we tried to dye. Next time I will just by the clothes the color I want them to be from the beginning. . It wasn't as good as the powdered product. . its dye
B00281K7UW,"Opened package to find yarn had been cut in several places . Cheap and ugly, but I should have known that when I bought it. . Not as soft as others I've bought in the past. . If you want a soft green color do not buy this! This is a bright green color, not at all like the picture shows! . It's inexpensive but a little rough to the touch. Color is consistent from skein to skein. Does the job, but nothing special. . working on the afghan now. . Yarn . Pros:. The price is great, and there seems to be a lot of yarn.  Bright color

Cons:. It's not soft at all and is thinner than many other yarns.  It's down right scratchy. . I was disappointed in my purchase.  The yarn was priced to imply that it was 14 oz skeins, but was really only 7 oz.  Also, the yarn has many knots in it, making it unusable at times. . Look, it's Red Heart. That means it's serviceable and affordable. However, after a spring and summer of working with superwash wool and 100% cotton, this feels stiff and rough. Yes, it'll soften up in the wash, particularly if I run it through a couple times with Snuggle, but still, I feel I've been spoiled by using equally affordable but higher quality yarns. For this project, it's worth it."
B004ZDL0K2,"I bought a set of 132 Prismacolor Premier pencils, and this sharpener. Two of those pencils were down to half their length before I had even used them more than once because the first time I tried to sharpen them, this sharpener kept breaking the lead. It broke the lead in almost all of the pencils, but two of them more than the others. I finally followed the advice of other reviewers and bought a Derwent battery operated sharpener, and I have not had a broken lead since. . I prefer my cheapies. . I've got a few of those tiny little one inch cheapy sharpeners. I've never had any problems with them except they are a bit small in the fingers when trying to sharpen a bunch at a time so when I saw this I figured, ""let's get serious about sharpening!""

It took me a few seconds to figure out the flip top and to strong arm open the shaving container but after that I got busy and sharpened about 20 pencils. I didn't have any breakage and the dual tip thing is pretty snazzy. The flip top is annoying and will likely break off after a while, do yourself a favor and just snap it off :) It'll hurt less.

Overall it's just a sharpener. The fact the when I need to sharpen I still reach for my cheapy little metal ones tells me everything. . its ok . I have wasted my life looking for a decent pencil sharpener. They don't exist. I know they don't exist but the quest goes on. This one is supposed to be for colored pencils. Right. They break the pencils just like every other sharpener I've used. Razor blade and sand paper. Final answer. . Doesn't have the power to sharpen! . Trash. Garbage. Do not waste your money. It will swallow up every pencil it comes in contact with. . I prefer the shape of this sharpener over the oval shaped sharpener (also a Prismacolor product); however, I am having a problem with a lot of broken leads.  I am not sure whether the problem is with my pencils (broken or off-centered leads) or a possible problem with using the sharpener. However, this sharpener is much easier to hold than the bullet shaped sharpener. . It sharpens fairly well but the glue holding the top together did not hold long, so it is not easy to open and empty. . it was not as sharp as it should be eats up my Prismacolor pencils"
B007QNXACE,"These are SMALL. I see it says ""bonbons"" but I was really not expecting that small. The whole package (with the 8 yarns bobbins) fits my hand palm. Will do maybe one or 2 small projects but no more I think.
I thought it was a good bargain but not that much given it is so small . well quite a bit smaller than expected but I can use these in my crafts . great small skeins . I'm really surprised how thin this yarn is. Generally I am all about Lion Brand for it's consistent quality and variety. But, I'm not sure about the Bonbons. The colors are fun and I like this set better as it's cotton, but it's a challenge to match the yarn with anything else. . I want to be very clear, I am not complaining about the size of the yarn; I'm complaining about the quality of the yarn, and the consistency of the product within one single package.

First off, the yarn in my package is fuzzy and splitty.  It's very thin for supposed sport weight yarn; going off looks alone I would have guessed it to be closer to fingering weight.  (I noticed another review calls it sock-weight yarn, so I'm not the only one who finds it thin.)  Even with that, the suggested hook size is 5.5mm--for comparison, that's also the recommended hook size for Red Heart Super Saver yarn, which is probably three times as thick as this stuff.  The knitting needle size is only 4mm.  There is not typically such a disparity between suggested hook and needle sizes.  If you use the recommended hook, you're guaranteed to be left with a sloppy, floppy disappointment.  The first picture I'm including is of some of the red skein.  It is NOT out of focus; the yarn is just fuzzy.

Now, the inconsistency problem.  Second photo is of 7/8 of my little skeins (I didn't think to take a photograph until after I'd used the red).  You can sort of tell from the product photo that they're not actually all the same size; it's more readily obvious in my photo.  The package claims that each skein of yarn is 28 yards.  The bright orange is visibly larger than the others.  The yellow didn't seem smaller, but nevertheless turned out to have less yarn in it than both the red and the light orange.  I was able to get a nice 6-round granny square from both the red and the light orange (which worked out to about 4.5""; see the third photo), with some left over, but the yellow skein came up short with half a round to go.  I've been crocheting for 25 years.  I am not a novice.  This is not an issue of inconsistent tension.  It's an issue of inconsistent amounts of yarn.  I actually felt bad for planning to leave a three star rating right up until I ran out of yellow yarn.

Here's my last issue: the colors don't really coordinate.  I don't know if this is an issue across all the colorways or not, but it is here.  The red and purple are fairly dark and rich.  The green and blue/teal are lighter but still fairly similar.  Then there are inexplicably three neon colors (bright orange, yellow, and pink) and the other orange is almost a pastel.  And why two shades of orange?  It's not red-orange or yellow-orange plus normal orange, it's neon and pastel orange.  I'll make it work, since it was a Valentine's Day gift, but it's not something that adheres to any decent standards of design or color theory. . Teeny Tiny skeins . WAY smaller than I understood, not worth the money. . I like it . this was deceiving. the thought these skeins would be larger than they were. They are just tiny skeins. . This is really small, and not as soft as it claims to be.  The produce could possibly be used for granny squares, otherwise this is pretty much useless"
B008QSJDGK,"This was a total waste of time and money. came from China, took over a month to get here and they break! I am using them while knitting socks and have broken five of them just gently passing them from one needle to the other and two of  them broke when I tried to close them . Save your money. Give me the old fashioned plastic rings or a loop of contrasting yarn, they work every time! . break too easily  but were very useful while they lasted . Never received this order from Islandoffer. Very disappointed. :-( . These stitch markers looked like ones that I bought from another website, but the quality of these are not as good. They are made of a thicker plastic, so they aren't as flexible as the others. Also, because they aren't particularly flexible, they brake easily. One broke for me the first time I used it. Most of them seem to be holding up, but it's hard to tell how well because I don't need more than one or two markers at a time. . they arrived way late and 11 of them were either broken or bent and wouldn't lock..I should had known better to order them..You get what you pay for.. . These markers were poorly made, they snap in half as you go to use them, I tried being very careful then asked a friend to use a few and the same thing happened to her...... it was a waste of money and anticipation... . These are the worst stitch markers I've ever had. The plastic is hard, not springy, which means they break when you try to open them. They are difficult to work with and they took forever to ship. I mean that the company took forever to get it to the shipper plus the transit time. I had to buy markers from my LYS as these hadn't arrived on time. . Just no.  They constantly break at the bottom!  I am already down to five after this order a couple months ago.  I need to find new stitch markers.  don't buy these. . This item was inexpensive, delivery a little slow but arrived when they said they would. Colors are brighter than these pastel colors. They do break easily. But work for what I wanted to hold my stitch when I stopped. I ended up getting a lot more than 20 pcs looks like someone just grabbed a handful and put them in a mailing envelope and sent them. I don't do a lot of crocheting so for me they work good. . I received an ugly orange color, a bright green one, pink and blue.  I know the colors are not guaranteed, but could they have at least been consistent on tones of colors?  One snapped apart so far in its first usage just to mark a stitch.  Cheap price = cheap product that does the job until they snap apart I guess."
