"None",  "Work's great for mosaic's and clay"
"None",  "Just in playing around with this for a half-hour I'm already looking for other sizes."
"None", "It's got a super-effective cutting mechanism leaving no ""hanging chads"", and is so simple to press that even a supervised child or arthritic senior can use this with comfort and ease."
"None", "It's bulky, mind you, but no more so than you'd expect. While it doesn't matter for cut-outs, realize that it does require you to be within about 1/2"" of the edge for matting purposes -- so you won't be able to punch out a window halfway down a scrapbook page, though I don't know any similarly priced, easily handled unit that offers such flexibility."
"None", "This is a great value, and I'll purchase from EK Success again in the future without hesitation."
"None", "The charm pack has Nice fall colors"
"None", "gift"
"None", "I just bought this as colored string.  It works fine for that purpose."
"None", "A little hard to get the paint started. Didn't cover as well as I had hoped. So I needed to go over it a few times."
"None", "I am looking for a pair to replace some that I have just used to death, but keep going back to because of a 'notched' place in the top of them just behind the 'horned part'.  It slips down over a bent wire and tucks the ends nicely.  Though these don't have that and I have yet to find them. This part does fit well in my hand and does everything else needed.  With the exception of the notch I am continuing to look for, these are fine."
"None", "I watched an online demonstration of crafters decorating greeting cards with these inks and bought a set of pearlized colors which included 'cherry chocolate' (a deep purple - see customer image for an example of a card that I decorated with cherry chocolate Smooch Pearlized Accent Ink.) They give better coverage than marking pens and the applicator allows you to color in very fine details. The ink is opaque, so you can use them over colored cardstock."
"None", "One of the 'features' I dislike about marking pens (the cheap ones, at least) is that the color is absorbed by the paper and spreads into areas I don't want it to go. You don't have to worry about spreading with these inks: they go on like enamel. Maybe that's why the bottles are designed to look like fingernail polish containers."
"Quality", "I also tried floating the inks on water to see if I could create marbled paper with them (as is shown in the demo video). I used 110 lb. cardstock, and the colors did take, but they were very light and their characteristic sheen didn't come through. Possibly glossy cardstock would serve as a better base for marbling with these Smooch Accent Inks. I won't be throwing away my regular marbling colors any time soon."
"None", "In summary, I can highly recommend this product to add color to greeting cards, especially small, stamped images, and decorative edging."
"Quality", "I purchased this punch tool because I've heard that EK Tools makes some good punchers.  I think the one I got was defective, because it gets stuck every once in a while.  I'll still continue to use it, but hate when it doesn't punch that well.  Sometimes the lock will get stuck and the punch doesn't lock, or you have to press really hard to get it to actually cut something (nothing thicker than regular cardstock).  It wasn't that expensize on Amazon, but I'm wondering if maybe I should have sprung for a Martha Stewart punch tool instead."
"Durability", "Junk. Fall apart quickly. Good for a square foot or two."
"None", "I can now use this pen to add glittered wording to my home-made cards!"
"None", "Best tape for paper crafters.  No need for scissors, just tear it by hand.  Works on all types of materials. The only drawback is that it is INSTANTLY sticky, so there are no second chances for placement."
"None", "this takes time to know how to use this but things sure are better with this on some things not all but some"
"Quality", "It is a bit strange that depending on how hard you push the sizers on the stick you get different numbers. so I only use it as a guideline, not the exact measure."
"None", "Placed the easy to handle strips on my cutting ruler and it does have just enough of a ridge to stop the ruler on the edge of the 2 plus layers of fabric."
"None", "love the colours, coordinating beads already put together, packed well and shipped quickly, have purchased several sets"
"None", "Christmas stocking gift"
"Quality", "I'm not convinced after a couple months of issuing it, that or has improved my scissors. I think it's wrecked them instead."
"None", "Great stamp set for paper crafting"
"None", "I was looking for a nice blank book for journaling and this definitely fits the bill. It is handmade with an embossed cover, has handmade paper bound into quartos within it, and a respectable amount of sheets. The attached thong keeps the book securely closed, so anything tucked into the pages will stay put nicely. I write with fountain pen and the paper is a tad more absorbent than I would like, but the ink doesnae bleed all the way through the page. That said, there is significant ghosting. If you use ballpoint or gel pen this will not be a concern. The size is convenient for handholding or tucking into your bag for travel."
"False Advertising", "I would purchase this again. The only reason the book gets four stars rather than five is that it is described as leatherbound and the cover is actually embossed pleather and NOT actual leather. The embossing on mine is rather faint and is slightly double embossed on the back cover as if they hit the die, the faux leather shifted and then they hit the die again. As long as you understand that you will not be getting real leather you should be quite happy with this book.  If you want truly premium embossing and thick cowhide leather go with Oberon leather but be prepared to pay for the premium craftsmanship and materials. If you are on a budget, this is perfect."
"None", "Love it! Cuts like a dream. This was purchased for an elementary school for the staff to use. I have designed things on a computer and ipads. I use an ipad to do the actual cutting part so I don't have to connect a computer with a cord. I find it easier to design on the computer where I have a mouse."
"False Advertising", "The reason for four stars is I feel a little deceived. You have to subscribe to a monthly service to get more than a handful of free things. I did not realize this after quite a bit of research. And when it says cut anything off the internet, this is not entirely true. it is not easy to take an image off line (even a simple black and white clip art) and make the layers it would require to properly cut out an image."
"None", "I also did not realize I could use my old cartridges. I haven't tried it yet, but there is a place to put them and then I assume the key pad will come up on my ipad since there is no keypad on this cricut."
"None", "Overall I have a lot to learn, but it has a lot more cool design features than my original cricut"
"None", "I really like the cutting die because all the little pieces cut at once, you don't have to cut out or punch one at a time.  It takes a little time to assemble the flower."
"None", "Delicate and cute. If you are working with length they tend to twist so iron on first."
"None", "Product was exactly as described."
"None", "worked great"
"False Advertising", "I ordered some of these from an online craft store and have to say when I received them I was dismayed.  They resemble a clamshell take out container, in that the lid is hinged to the bottom.  They are clear plastic so whatever is stored inside is easy to see."
"Quality", "They are surprisingly sturdy.  The plastic is  thick and though it does flex a little, it holds its shape. when held in the air.  The only negatives for me are that the lid presses so tightly into the bottom of the box it's hard to open AND the plastic edge of the lid sharp so you have to be careful when opening the box."
"None", "These boxes stack well on top of each other (because of the recessed lid) so they aren't going to slide off each other if accidentally joggled."
"None", "All in all I am pleased with these, which I have in both the 8.5 x 11 inch size and the 12 x 12 size."
"None", "There are a lot of little gold beads, they came on time and they are just what the picture shows them to be, there's not much one can say about the beads other than they are what they are."
"Quality", "No good they don't stick."
"None", "These are such a nice alternative from the orange scissors you see everywhere.  They work great, feel solid/sturdy, and I love the colors."
"Quality", "I'm not going to buy this kind of paint again. It is so chalky and gets dry even in the bottle. Sorry."
"None", "Pleased with the 32-compartment Darice No Spill Organizer. I make jewelry and these containers work well for storing beads, findings, buttons, etc. It is not transparent (like acrylic) but is translucent enough to see easily what color range is stored inside without having to open it. Handy, stackable, easy to wipe clean when the dust bunnies start to multiply, and at a decent cost."
"Quality", "I bought this to help with measuring my fabric for cutting.  I'm an intermediately experienced sewer but I really suck at measuring my fabric and getting it straight.  This has been a great help!  The only complaint I have so far is that it's pretty thin and flexible.  It also tends to move a bit if you're not pushing down hard enough to prevent it from slipping.  (This is while using a rotary cutter.)  For the price I was looking for I won't complain much."
"Durability", "Love this metal loom...can bend if you're not careful, BUT much more durable than the plastic looms. Got this for my daughter to use."
"Quality", "The chalk in the pencils is very hard. It doesn't mark well enough to see. I wasn't happy with the product and will not purchase more in the future."
"Quality", "These are about as cheaply made as possible. Oh they do the job they're designed for but don't leave one on a project in storage that gets jostled around because those numbers will not be where you left them. 3 stars for bare minimum effort."
"None", "I like this wire. This is a new hobby for me and I am enjoying the different type of jewelry wire out here.  The wire gauge is just right for what I want to accomplish.  However, I was surprised at how small the spool of wire was when I received it. However, the wire does go a long way and I still have enough on each spool that I've ordered.  I ordered in different gauges.....20 and 24; copper and silver.  I am  enjoying all the projects that I have completed with these wires. Delivery was excellent.  I love Amazon Prime."
"None", "Holes appear too large but do fit every post I've tried them on.  A bargain."
"None", "will buy again in larger size, it was good for my small projects"
"None", "Has a notch all the way up the back that creates a flat surface, which has actually be helpful for me as I'm wire-wrapping rings with large, flat central beads, but might be annoying for anyone who wants to wrap a perfectly round ring. Great price, especially considering you get both the mandrel and sizing rings."
"Quality", "stiff and uneven lay"
"False Advertising", "The price for this product was much more than I would have paid in the store, but I needed it and could not find in any stores.  The color was slightly different although they were both light gray.  I will definitely make sure that I have enough of the necessary color before I start another project."
"Quality", "After putting on the yarn guide, which is very much made like the toys kids  get in the front of the store with the bubble gum, I realized that I use my left hand to pull the stitches closer the end of the hook as I crochet.  Having this on my pointer finger inhibits that process, and it just isn't comfortable.  It isn't worth returning, but I probably won't use it."
"None", "Nice paper.  A little on the thin side.  The foil and patterns are pretty.  I would probably buy this again.  I would recommend this to any crafter looking to expand their paper selection.  I have no complaints about this product."
"Quality", "I really would like more info on these clear get stamps. But I suppose it will be okay when I figure out how to use it. Wish company would insert suggestions for best use."
