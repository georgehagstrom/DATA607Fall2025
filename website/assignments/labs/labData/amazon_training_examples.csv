"None",   "I like this a lot it holds my crochet patterns, knitting patterns, and charts. The magnets are very strong and can hold 16 pages or more if you put the smaller magnet under the long magnet, or  11 pages nicely (I haven't tried any more then that). The pattern holder works best if horizontal. The long magnet fits across the holder and seams sturdier. When the holder is vertical the long magnet is to long for the holder and hangs off the sides and seams like it is less sturdy. If you look at the picture amazon is displaying or do a google search it is horizontal. I would suggest you print all patterns using the landscape format on your printer if you can. For the patterns that I already printed out and are vertical I put the pattern holder flat and prop it up. There is a snap closure and a pocket to keep extra patterns or notions and things. The pen holder is nice I just wish it were elastic, it still holds the pen in place if you use it with the clip to hold on to the pen holder.  WARNING: Small magnetic parts keep them away from young children and pets. Watch your fingers when removing or placing the small magnets on the holder they can snap together and give your fingers quite a pinch."
"Durability", "Bends too easy. Tool comes loose from handle."
"Quality", "the handle is a little awkward and the actual hook is a little smaller than my other needle and I kept loosing the yarn"
"Quality Control", "Well I wanted to love this and I almost did! I needed white glossy cardstock to cut circles out for a huge canvas piece I was going to throw on the wall. First two or three packs were perfect, I ordered two more only to find out after I had cut them that they were not the same white!  And there was NO WAY this would blend together! Complete waste and now I'm back at square one! I would not recommend this, how can you do a project if your material isn't the same color "
"False Advertising", "Not what i expected. I thing it would stay ""tacky"" after drying, but it's a permanent adhesive. The name is misleading. I was looking fora temporary adhesive"
