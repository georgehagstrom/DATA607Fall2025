### Overview

Each student needs to complete one data science in context presentation. These are short presentations with a target length of 5-7 minutes. At the beginning of the semester you should sign
up for a presentation slot using this [sign up sheet](https://doodle.com/sign-up-sheet/participate/73d10cce-87fd-48eb-9e20-760138efedfb/select). The presentations will be made live in class, with an opportunity for a few minutes of question or discussion. You can pick any
topic that interests you and is related to data science. If you have a strong preference not to present live, you may record and upload your presentation separately.
