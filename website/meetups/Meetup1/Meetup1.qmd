## What is Data Science?

. . .

* Data science is a "discipline that allows you to transform raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge"

. . .

* I hear often: "Data Science is just statistics with a clever brand name"

. . .
 
* Is this a misconception?

## Data Science Workflow

Consider this visualization of the process for converting raw data into knowledge:

## Data Science Workflow

Consider this visualization of the process for converting raw data into knowledge:

![Figure from text](DSWFImport.png){width="80%"}

Load the data from files into software

## Data Science Workflow

Consider this visualization of the process for converting raw data into knowledge:

![Figure from text](DSWFTidy.png){width="80%"}

Tidy the data so it is stored in a consistent way

## Data Science Workflow

Consider this visualization of the process for converting raw data into knowledge:

![Figure from text](DSFWTransform.png){width="80%"}

Transform the data to focus our analysis on observations of interest

## Data Science Workflow

Consider this visualization of the process for converting raw data into knowledge:

![Figure from text](DSFWVisualize.png){width="80%"}

Visualize the data to find relationships, problems, and pose questions

## Data Science Workflow

Consider this visualization of the process for converting raw data into knowledge:

![Figure from text](DSFWModel.png){width="80%"}

Model the data to answer questions precisely using statistics

## Data Science Workflow

Consider this visualization of the process for converting raw data into knowledge:

![Figure from text](DSFWCommunicate.png){width="80%"}

Communicate to share results with others

## Data Science Workflow

Consider this visualization of the process for converting raw data into knowledge:

![Figure from text](DSFWNoModel.png){width="80%"}

This class will focus on everything but modeling, i.e. the part of Data Science that isn't statistics

## Modeling can be small part of Data Science projects

It is said that 80% of time in data science projects is spent on data mining, cleaning, tidying, exploratory data analysis, etc

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Data on how bacteria get their food in the ocean
-   Getting data for this plot took months.....
-   Many sources, data formats, quality issues, processing

## Learning objectives

By the end of the course, you will have a foundation of skills in the Data Science Workflow

-   Find data you need and do all steps to prep it for analysis
-   Build expertise in R and the `tidyverse`
-   Use and understand relational databases and SQL
-   Collaborate with Git and GitHub
-   Introduce you to distributed computing and other tools for large datasets
-   Improve your programming ability
