## Introduction

In this report we will look at power generation in several different countries, visualize
how the share of electricity from different sources has changed over time, and look at how
that associates with the carbon emissions from electricity generation.

### Packages

We will use the **tidyverse**, **lubridate**, **scales**, **patchwork**, and **ggthemes**,  for data wrangling and visualization, and the **DT** package for interactive display of tabular output.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
library(patchwork)
library(ggthemes)
library(DT)


knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)

```


### Data

The data we are using comes from the website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).
Specifically, we are using a dataset compiled there on energy production and use around the world. The dataset can be found at [Our World in Data's github page](https://github.com/owid/energy-data?tab=readme-ov-file), which contains both the dataset
and a codebook describing the meaning of all the variables. We used [owid-energy-data.csv](https://github.com/owid/energy-data/blob/master/owid-energy-data.csv) for 
this analysis.

```{r}
#| label: LoadData

energy_data = read_csv("owid-energy-data.csv")

```

## Energy Production over Time

We are going to display a visualization which shows how the energy generation in several
different countries, specifically China, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United States,
changed over time. It is possible to change the countries being visualized by changing the
countries listed in the `countries_included` variable below
replacing the `iso_code` labels with those corresponding to the countries of interest to you. 

```{r}
countries_included = c("USA","DEU","FRA","SWE","CHN")
```

We picked a small subset of the variables available in this dataset to visualize, picking the
ones that are most important for overall power generation and have greatest influence on 
carbon emissions, namely coal, natural gas (methane), hydro, nuclear, solar, and wind. These
choices can similarly be changed by finding where they occur in the `select` and `pivot_longer`
functions. 

See the [Appendix](#appendix) for a list of the countries and variables present in the
data.

```{r}
#| label: ElecGenerationOverTime
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

plot1 = energy_data |> 
  filter(iso_code %in% countries_included, year > 1980) |> 
  group_by(iso_code,country) |> 
  select(iso_code,
         year,
         hydro_share_elec,
         wind_share_elec,
         solar_share_elec,
         coal_share_elec,
         gas_share_elec,
         nuclear_share_elec) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("hydro_share_elec",
             "wind_share_elec",
             "solar_share_elec",
             "coal_share_elec",
             "gas_share_elec",
             "nuclear_share_elec"),
    names_to = "GeneratorType",
    values_to = "Electricity_Per_Capita"
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=Electricity_Per_Capita,color=country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ GeneratorType, scales = "free") +
 theme_classic() +
  ylab("Share of Electricity from Different Sources") +
  xlab("Year") +
  labs(title = "Change in Electricity Generation Share over time",
       color = "Country")

```

### Impact of Power Sources on Carbon Intensity of Electricity Production

Many countries have set ambitious targets for reducing their carbon emissions. One way to
visualize carbon emissions is to look at how much carbon dioxide is emitted for each unit
of electrical energy generated. This measure called the **carbon intensity of electricity 
generation**. We will visualize carbon intensity in two ways: looking at how carbon intensity
has changed over time in the selected countries, and also looking across the entire dataset
and seeing how carbon intensity relates to coal power and the sum of all low carbon forms
of power generation (nuclear, hydro, solar, wind). 

```{r}
#| label: CarbonIntensity
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 4

plot2 = energy_data |> 
  filter(iso_code %in% countries_included, year > 1980) |> 
  group_by(iso_code,country) |> 
  select(iso_code,
         country,
         year,
         low_carbon_share_elec,
         coal_share_elec,
         carbon_intensity_elec
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=low_carbon_share_elec,y=coal_share_elec,color=carbon_intensity_elec,shape=country)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Controls on Carbon Intensity",
       color = "Carbon Intensity",
       x = "Low Carbon Electricity Share",
       y = "Coal Electricity Share")
  
plot3 = energy_data |> 
  filter(iso_code %in% countries_included, year > 1980) |> 
  group_by(iso_code,country) |> 
  select(iso_code,
         country,
         year,
         carbon_intensity_elec
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=carbon_intensity_elec,color=country)) +
  geom_smooth(show.legend = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE, se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("Carbon Intensity of Electricity Production") +
  xlab("Year") +
  labs(title = "Carbon Intensity over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Carbon Intensity of Electricity (CO2e / kWhr)")

plot3 + plot2;
```

### Putting it Together

We can create the original compound plot using the following command (made possible by the
`patchwork` package):

```{r}
#| label: CompoundFigure
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 10
plot1 / (plot3 + plot2)


```
